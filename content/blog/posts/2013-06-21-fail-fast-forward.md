If we stopped regretting our past screw-ups and invested that time improving, would we move on faster?

You bet.

Not only faster, but smarter, and more compassionately. The moment you decide to <a title="Get rid of guilt" href="http://www.gr0wing.com/get-rid-of-guilt/" target="_blank">bypass guilt</a> and replace it with the excitement of changing, a huge window opens and you feel compelled to spread the virus.

Since 10 years, I&#8217;ve been experimenting with various tools to leverage failure instead of sinking in it, I won&#8217;t claim my training is over but I found a few approaches that work great, in particular **Fail Fast Forward**. It&#8217;s a process that doesn&#8217;t take much, just three steps to repeat constantly.

If you&#8217;d like to try it for yourself, here&#8217;s the method:

  1. **Fail**: when you fail, just face it. At least you honestly tried this time.
  2. **Fast**: making a mistake is not a reason to dwell on self-blame. Guilt is for those who live eternally, you won&#8217;t. Move on.
  3. **Forward**: how can you make it better now? Would it be OK to do it&#8230;differently?

Faced with a choice between **stagnation** and **evolution**, we often choose the comfort of immobility, no matter how depressing and inappropriate that place might be. Motionlessness is a ham-fisted attempt at reaching contentment. In fact it&#8217;s unacceptable.

Changing, on the other hand is costly and totally painful, you don&#8217;t have to. But there&#8217;s a Japanese saying for that: **&#8220;We are fools whether we dance or not, so we might as well dance.&#8221;**
