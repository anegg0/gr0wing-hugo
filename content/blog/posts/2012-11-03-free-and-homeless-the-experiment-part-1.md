<p style="background-color: silver;">
  Back in NYC, after a week with the old Tibetan Master.<br /> The city&#8217;s not a problem. My painful brain is.
</p>

The transition from the quiet retreat place to New York was easy: I&#8217;m getting used to changing contexts all the time.

But my mind keeps malfunctioning. That&#8217;s the difficult part.

My brain is a pain.

It&#8217;s like a problem dog: I have to keep it completely busy all the time.

If I don&#8217;t, it starts chewing on everything, sometimes it gets anxious and it attacks me.

It keeps asking questions, in the back of my head, all the time:

&#8211; **What the hell are we doing here?**

&#8211; **Is there something happening after we die, or is just like a bulb that blinks out?**

&#8211; **What&#8217;s the meaning of life, other than trying to impress your fellow humans?**

These questions are meant to be disposed at adulthood, normally.

I guess most people manage to get rid of that psycho babble in their 20&#8217;s. At worst, they choose to worry about something more accessible, like getting a raise or taking care of their kids.

Kudos to those who phased out the fundamental questioning, I couldn&#8217;t.

And even when I tried, my mind didn&#8217;t obey me: it kept chewing on hard thoughts. Death for instance, that&#8217;s its favorite toy.

I wish I could shut down the goddamn thing, sometimes, put it to sleep.  
I would just grab a can of beer, watch some moronic sports game, get passionate about imbeciles chasing a ball. Forget about everything.

Or I would just believe in GOD &#8211; Who created everything, the animals, walmarts, earthquakes and all that junk. Wouldn&#8217;t that be nice?

. All I would have to do is adore this son-of-a-bitch.

No, seriously, my mind is just too young to settle with anything

BTW, In my last post (link), I claimed I would talk about finding a spirituality with the TV on.

That was a total lie: I don&#8217;t think that you can find a spirituality until you turn the goddamn thing off.
