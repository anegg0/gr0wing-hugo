<p style="background-color: silver;">
  I&#8217;ve often compromised my freedom for money,<br /> but I&#8217;d like to solve that<span style="background-color: silver;"> dilemma, now.<br /> Not sure I can, but I&#8217;ll try.</span>
</p>

10th Episode: &#8220;Money&#8221;.

I love to be free and not go to work, but freedom doesn&#8217;t pay much (and I **HATE** being broke).<!--more-->

On the other end, working in an office ensures the comfort of a payroll, but if you put me on a 9 to 5 for too long, I go insane like a lab rat.

I need to do something about that Money VS Freedom problem. Being more creative will help, but a lot of work as well.

Screw it, I&#8217;m nearly forty and I&#8217;m questioning the fundamentals again.

&nbsp;

### Money: the controlling force

So far, I&#8217;ve dealt with money using two radical strategies:

&#8211; Taking whatever job is available, just for the money (that includes scrubbing  factories floors with Chlorhydric acid, which is extremely exciting, I recommend that).

OR

&#8211; Dropping out of Babylon and focusing on meaningful choices for NO money (being a <a title="4 things you should know if you want to be a Buddhist monk" href="http://www.gr0wing.com/4-things-you-should-know-if-you-want-to-be-a-buddhist-monk/" target="_blank">Buddhist Monk</a> or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector" target="_blank"><em>conscientious objector</em></a>, for instance)

To summarize: I either **had a job** or **had a life**. Never had both at the same time.

That&#8217;s what being an adult means, I thought, everybody is, more or less trapped in this equation.

Until a brilliant insight occurred to me 6 months ago:

Do I really need to SUFFER A LOT to deserve an income?

Why not make money doing something I like?

And here I am. I made that step, doing what I like BUT now:  
I&#8217;m without a house and going broke.

&nbsp;

### Staying ambitious

<a href="http://www.gr0wing.com/about/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" title="Pimp-c-gael" src="http://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Pimp-c-gael-258x300.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="300" /></a>

So, let me recap the initial idea: getting paid for what I like to do.

What I like to do is: travel the world, learn about spiritualities and people and countries.

I want to write about all that and pay the bills that way.

I would use my blog as a communication channel, and books.

Maybe it&#8217;s unrealistic, but how would I know if I don&#8217;t try?

BTW, For those who wonder how to make money with a blog, I suggest you check <a href="http://christianpf.com/how-to-make-money-with-a-blog/" target="_blank">this article</a>.

And for those who wonder how to make money writing a book, well, I guess <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140314446X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=grotherooofha-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=140314446X" target="_blank">talking shit</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=grotherooofha-20&l=as2&o=1&a=140314446X" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> is the quickest option, but you can do it and stay honest, too.

&nbsp;

Ok, I&#8217;m not crazy, though, I know that it&#8217;s not going to happen overnight. I have a plan B to pay the bills before I&#8217;m a famous and highly respected writer.

&nbsp;

#### Salesman

I sell software development services for a French company.

Been doing that  for four years, and lately I decided to go virtual:

No office

No hours

I can work wherever I want, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I hardly ever see my customers.

Don&#8217;t believe that great professional opportunity grew overnight, like a Mushroom. I earned it by working office hours (and more) for four years.

I&#8217;ve started closing my first contracts this way, so far so good. But it&#8217;s still not enough yet.

&nbsp;

Here comes the critical period, the time when I&#8217;m going to see if bankruptcy or enlightenment are at the end of the road, here&#8217;s a glimpse of my current financial status.

### Right now: the financial gauge

Until a month ago, I&#8217;ve lived on a lump of money, partly saved, partly borrowed.

But as I&#8217;m writing those lines, my checking account looks as hollow as a GOP opening speech.

&nbsp;

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This whole thing could leave me dry and humiliated.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Yet, for some reason, I&#8217;m not really scared and I enjoy the experience of financial bungee jumping.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  At the very worst, I&#8217;ve had months of fun, a lot of it :)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I hope to give you good news over the next weeks.
