Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) is regarded as a socially acceptable form of  insanity. Supposedly that syndrome needs a treatment and thousands of kids are now medicated to control their &#8220;deficit&#8221;.

They claim it might be a genetic problem. Yeah, right, blame it on DNA now&#8230;

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5132" alt="640px-Ritalin" src="http://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/640px-Ritalin-300x156.jpg" width="300" height="156" srcset="https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/640px-Ritalin-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/640px-Ritalin-588x305.jpg 588w, https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/640px-Ritalin.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> 

What if ADD was a not a disorder, but a normal response to a society gone out of whack?

What if it was increasingly challenging to remain focused in the hostile and ads-bombarded world we built for the next generation?

If that&#8217;s the case, then Ritalin is just a convenient way to ignore the main issue: people with ADD are normal, it&#8217;s our lifestyle that went wrong.

&nbsp;

Enough ranting, there are ways to solve the problem, that&#8217;s what this blog is about.

I was a kid with &#8220;ADD&#8221;, and  I spent the last 20 years working at tweaking my life out of that tendency.

To do that efficiently, I carefully observed a vast number of people that don&#8217;t have any problem with attention, people that have a settled mind, whether they are meditation masters or hard working parents. I wanted to role-model them, so I investigated on what they have in common.

You&#8217;d like to get my report?

As an exclusive offer for you, my readers, here&#8217;s the positive habits of focused and calm people:

### A &#8211; Taking cats as spiritual masters

Cats are weird, self-centered bastards. But they know how to focus and relax.

They won&#8217;t mind giving you live tutorials on how to do that properly.

### B &#8211; Going frugal

The focused people that I know don&#8217;t let money be a concern, they&#8217;re healthy financially but certainly not shopping addicts, they often limit themselves to a <a href="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/" target="_blank">minimalist lifestyle</a>.

When you decide to spend less, you&#8217;re less concerned about money and you don&#8217;t need to work as much. That frees quality time for yourself which in turn promotes a calmer state of mind. I invite you to join the stingy community of the &#8220;Frugal&#8221; Subreddit if you need inspiration: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/frugal" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/frugal</a>

###  C &#8211; Shutting <span style="font-size: 1.17em;">TV </span><span style="font-size: 1.17em;">down</span>

That goes without saying: there&#8217;s nothing wrong with TV as long as it&#8217;s off. Just kidding.

No, actually not, try to shut TV down for a week, I&#8217;ll give your money back if that doesn&#8217;t increase your capacity to focus.

### D &#8211; Dealing with frustration

Who said we shouldn&#8217;t have to deal with pain?

Big Pharma.

Yet, suffering is part of the deal we made with life as we were born, it&#8217;s a signal that tells us that we&#8217;re out of track and that we should change.

Nothing that we can&#8217;t handle.

People succesfull at being calm are also successful at NOT being calm: they can take the pain of feeling upset, they don&#8217;t reject it. They&#8217;re not attached to it either.

And they&#8217;re calmer, obviously.

### E &#8211; Rooting yourself

The first person to establish a genuine connection with is you. Body and mind.

Here&#8217;s some effective ways to do that:

  * Meditation
  * Yoga
  * Tai-Chi
  * Martial arts

That&#8217;s only to name a few.

Although rooting oneself may sound like an exotic option, it should be fundamental to all those who want to achieve a peaceful mindset.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As you noticed all the examples I&#8217;ve taken are not a part of western culture. Feel free to let me know if you can think of a &#8220;self-rooting&#8221; practice that belongs to Western traditions in the comments section below :)
