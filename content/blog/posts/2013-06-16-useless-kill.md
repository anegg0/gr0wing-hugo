I remember, my friend didn&#8217;t give it a second thought, as soon as he saw the spider cross the room, he just grabbed a used newspaper, rolled it up and **BAM!** Smashed the insect flat on the ground.

Then he got angry because the poor thing&#8217;s corpse had stained the kitchen&#8217;s floor.

## What makes us care more for a puppy than for a spider?

Both  are animals, but they&#8217;re looked upon differently by humans. Sure, it&#8217;s more difficult to identify with spiders. And killing them is not punished by law.

And they&#8217;re ugly.

What if spiders could moan, though?

Would their condition improve in a human dominated environment?  
Would they be worthy of our compassion, then?

The set of rules that defines who has the right to live and who doesn&#8217;t revolves around our personal interests, but we could function differently.

In Buddhism for instance all life forms are considered important. Not because they&#8217;re smart or useful, but because they can suffer. I we lived in an evolved society, we would probably stop killing bugs for the sake of it.

Talking about a small change to make in our daily life, that could be one.<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><br /> </span>
