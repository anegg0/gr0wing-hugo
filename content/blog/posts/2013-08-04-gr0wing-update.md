Hi, I&#8217;m Gael Blanchemain, the guy that started gr0wing.com.

I&#8217;d like to thank you for taking the time to stop by, and more particularly I want to say that I feel extremely grateful to those who supported this blog since its creation in 2012 by sending me email and friending me on FB.

I&#8217;ll also take this opportunity to give an you update on gr0wing:

## Change

Those who&#8217;ve known the site&#8217;s debut noticed the layout and URL change. The idea was to get a more polished look and a simple URL: www.gr0wing.com (gaelblanchemain.com will eventually be my personal author&#8217;s blog).

I&#8217;ve had a series of epiphanies last year, first because I understood the importance of connecting with like-minded individuals via the Internet and learn from each other. It&#8217;s wise and meaningful to collaborate, and it&#8217;s becoming  all the more vital as governments and large institutions no longer seem to be in touch with the actual needs of their citizens. I think only connected humans with a strong will to change their life and help others can make a difference. They need a platform to meet.

Facebook allows that type of connection to a limited (and highly controlled) extent, and it&#8217;s just not enough.

As a response to that need for collective thinking, gr0wing will evolve to be a hub for those who want to share ideas on how to respond to the challenges of the 2010&#8217;s. That means more guest posts and possibly a forum.

Secondly, I&#8217;ve [traveled the world][1] from couch to couch for more than a year. In the process, I gained awareness on the need to think differently about money and professional life. There are many new options, they&#8217;re the future and I&#8217;ll talk about them this year.

Being threatened by financial problems is no fun (I&#8217;m speaking from experience), that&#8217;s why gr0wing will now include tips on money management. I&#8217;ll start with an interview with my friend Philip Jedar who&#8217;s become an expert in this field.  
The goal of this money related content will be to avoid financial traps and leverage new tools like Bitcoin.

## Up

With a traffic that&#8217;s increasing steadily, gr0wing.com is becoming an online resource for those who want to actively change every aspect of their life:

  * Professional
  * Personal
  * Financial
  * Spiritual

I&#8217;ll make sure this project continues to improve to offer the best content for personal transformation and creative networking.

I look forward to see more free-thinkers and self-help addicts join our tribe, in the meantime stay in touch, and if you want to secure your connection to gr0wing.com, subscribe to [The Fertilizer][2], its weekly update.

Thank you!
