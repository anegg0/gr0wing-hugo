Here&#8217;s a short guide of how to travel the world and continue to make money.

This post has been inspired by the many questions I received on my <a title="Free and homeless: the experiment – part 1" href="http://www.gr0wing.com/free-and-homeless-part-1/" target="_blank">&#8220;Homeless and Free&#8221; experiment</a> which consists in going for a 6 months trip while continuing to earn income.

### Streams of income

Making money = **generating streams of income**.

Streams of income can be:

&#8211; Active income (having a day job or being a freelancer)  
&#8211; Passive income (blogging, real estate profit)

Remember: having a day job is not the only way to make money, you don&#8217;t have to have a day job.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

On site vs Remotely

While on a trip, you can make money **on site** or **remotely**.

An on site job is a job you&#8217;ll do at your country of destination.

A remote job is a job that you can do wherever you want.

Typical examples of &#8220;on site&#8221; jobs:

&#8211; waiter (waitress)  
&#8211; bar tender  
&#8211; tourist guide  
&#8211; language teacher (for short durations)

Examples of &#8220;remote&#8221; jobs:

&#8211; Translation  
&#8211; Edition  
&#8211; Graphic design  
&#8211; Sales  
&#8211; Blogging

&nbsp;

Both have their pros and cons, I&#8217;ve filtered the most important questions you should ask yourself to choose what option is best for you:

I personally chose two streams of income:

&#8211; Sales in the IT industry

&#8211; Blog: the one you&#8217;re just reading now

I&#8217;m an independent sales person, that allows me to generate substantial income. Although irregular, that income is enough to fuel my trip and pay the taxes :)

I&#8217;m also a blogger, which brings negligible financial value for now (this blog is 4 months old), but will be profitable within 6 months.

The benefit of those twe

Connexion!

I recommend usingan USB modem to ensure maximum connectiviy everywhere.

Connexions offered by hotels are often slow, prone to shut downs and a hassle to configure.

The traps

&#8211; leeching

&#8211; not buffering

&#8211; no remote admin

### Assess your value

When you make money, you offer value in exchange of some form of currency.

Making money _while you travel _means offering  value either **to the countries you visit** or **from the countries you visit** (that&#8217;s if you work remotely).

&nbsp;

or  to assess what value you can deliver to the place

A good place to start is by asking yourself:  
**What can I offer that others would be HAPPY to pay for?**

There is a lot that you can already offer in a foreign country, I bet you&#8217;re unaware of most of it.

Examples:

&#8211; **Can you speak a foreign language?** (hint: yes, you can > your language is a foreign language in the countries you&#8217;ll visit)  
&#8211; **Do you have good communication skills?**  
&#8211; **Can you use a computer?**  
&#8211; **Are you attractive? Impressive? Do you inspire confidence? **(all of them are useful if you work in a hotel, in sales or in a club for instance)  
&#8211; **Do you know how to deal with people from your country?** (hint: in the foreign places where you&#8217;ll go, they probably can&#8217;t)  
&#8211; **Can you play a sport at a competitive level? **

These are only a few examples of what you are right now, all of these qualities have a specific value in the right context.

Try and make a list of your personal assets if you can: list 20 things you have, don&#8217;t think about how valuable it is for now, just jot them down.

rank the most critical assets you have h

There&#8217;s a host of things you can already trade for money:

As a traveller, you have plenty of opportunities to make money. The key is to be creative and open.
