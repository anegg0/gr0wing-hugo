&#8220;Nothing to do or undo,  
nothing to force,  
nothing to want,  
and nothing missing&#8221; &#8211; Lama Gendun

When I started practicing Buddhism, I thought the point of meditation was to &#8220;quiet my mind&#8221; and make it **shut up** for a while, so I would sit on my pillow, stiff as a corpse, and I would try hard to remain still, and hush my thoughts.

It didn&#8217;t really work, I actually ended up angrier after those kinds of &#8220;meditations&#8221;.

Later on, my teacher explained to me that the point of meditation was not to freeze mental activity, but to observe it and let go, nothing else.  
Sounds like a simple thing to do, right? At the time I thought it was no big deal, I just needed to quit being a control-freak which I thought would be pretty easy.

I was wrong, this instruction turned out to be a life project for me. I&#8217;m still working on it, 20 years later.

You can only gain serenity if first accept your inner chaos, your fears, your anger and the whole enchilada of cumbersome neurosis. There&#8217;s no controlling your mind if you don&#8217;t first come to peace with it. As it is, whether you like it or not, and it&#8217;s a hard thing to do.

I came to appreciate how that principle applies to most areas of human life: politics, relationships, jobs, and more particularly to oneself.  
Whatever you want to change must be accepted first, as such. Long term changes won&#8217;t work otherwise.

Needless to say, this acceptance thing takes time, I don&#8217;t have any shortcut to share, in this article.

Only one more thing, maybe: is there still a point in changing the things you already accepted?
