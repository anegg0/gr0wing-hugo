I was quietly watching a documentary with my wife when the phone rang: the icy voice of my boss informed me that I was supposed to be at work at 6…it was 7pm.

Great, that&#8217;s all I needed: an unexpected night-shift with a resented supervisor.

In my worst mood, I jumped in my pants at quantum speed, then ran across the street toward the train station, but there was an approaching car which didn&#8217;t see me.

When I realized that the car was heading full speed in my direction, things went slow motion.

I heard a screeching noise…

The driver had stopped just in time, his face was livid, he made made sincere efforts to calm me down while I was cursing him out, my hands on his door, I was just mad and in shock, I think he understood.

He apologized sincerely, what else could he do, anyway? I didn&#8217;t get hurt, no real harm had been done, I reasoned myself and let him go.

Now I was alone in the street. Alone, stressed, late for work and very mad. And I only had 30 minutes to blow off steam before starting my shift.  
It was time to recall what I have learned about mind control and stress reduction.

Here are the emergency tricks that I used to recover from my fit of temper. I hope they inspire those among you who release the dogs of anger a little too fast…like me.

## Root yourself

When angry, stop whatever you&#8217;re doing and fully open up to your body sensations. Give yourself a minute to experience the physical buzz of anger: shaky hands, cold sweat, racing heart. Breathe deep, slow down and bring your awareness to every part of your body.

While you might feel awkward during the first seconds of this exercise, you&#8217;ll get back to balance surprisingly fast. Learn to reconnect your mind and body together, it&#8217;s the simplest way to regain control.

## Watch your mental firework

Anger is like a comet followed by a blazing trail of thoughts. This emotion tends to wake up our darkest thinking patterns and it&#8217;s tempting to react on them. Just remember that mental agitation is totally harmless as long as you don&#8217;t contribute to it. Let thoughts go, don&#8217;t engage in the &#8220;How could he?&#8221; or &#8220;I should have…&#8221; type of questions. Just let the chatter happen.

Serenity is not so much a matter of inner silence, it&#8217;s about how relaxed you can be with your own thoughts.  
Enjoy the inner show, it can&#8217;t harm you if you don&#8217;t take part in it.

## A bit of compassion

Sometimes, practicing compassion means having the curiosity to understand your pain and the pain of those who made you angry.

It&#8217;s easy to relate to the distress of someone who almost ran over a pedestrian, let alone the stress of the pedestrian himself!

Slip your feet in everyone&#8217;s shoes, imagine how it feels to be in their position, it&#8217;s surely the best way to dissolve hard feelings.

Buddhist teachings claim that compassion is the best antidote against aversion, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d probably agree but see it for yourself, your experience will speak louder than a teaching given 2500 ago.

Anger is no enemy, nor is it a friend, merely a passing emotion, it&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll do with it that&#8217;ll make a difference. 

Will you have the courage, the kindness to pacify the dogs of anger?
