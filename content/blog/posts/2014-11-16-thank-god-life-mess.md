It&#8217;s been there for a week, and chances are that heap of shame will build up for another three days. Stained T-shirts, moldy work-out outfits, ugh&#8230;.

I could solve the problem by sorting out the mess now, yet by the time I&#8217;m done with laundry, the kitchen&#8217;s sink will be full of saucy frying pans and floating crumbs. Again.

Cleaning the apartment is an endless task, everything is at least 30% messy, if not downright disgusting.

And the same goes for my unfinished task lists, abandonned novels and broken promises.

What was the last time you felt totally satisfied with a project?

Personally, I can&#8217;t remember&#8230;Everything I did was a bitter-sweet mixture of random achievements and failures, there&#8217;s always been a mismatch between how I wanted my life to be and what it looked like.

And it turned out to be a pretty good thing.

> &#8220;Life is what happens while you have other projects&#8221;

Said a famous guy whose messy life ended abruptly with seven wound shots.  
He was right, not only life throws at us whatever it pleases, but this often results in a deep overhaul of our value system.

One of my best friends was once my worst enemy, it took 5 years working with him to tolerate his differences and to regard them as the qualities I lacked: he&#8217;s patient when I&#8217;m not, tenacious when I slack off and detail-oriented when I&#8217;m sloppy.

Spending time with him felt like a goddamn boot camp: he reflected my shortcomings perfectly every day, and he also taught me that to him, my nastiest tendencies were also the qualities he so badly needed&#8230;depending on circumstances.

Is your current partner the one you had planned ten years ago? What about your friends?

I bet you hadn&#8217;t pictured them on your life project, did you?

Do I push it too far if I say that our loved ones made us progress by NOT being what we wanted them to be?

I guess that&#8217;s what I have in my mind when I praise our mess, since what we label chaos is probably nothing else than what we need to grow: the fertilizer, and the magic too.

I don&#8217;t intend to patronize you about what outlook you should have on your life, you have your own personal mess to take care of and I don&#8217;t know what it contains, but rest assured that to my eyes, what you&#8217;re uncomfortable with might be what makes you unique and interesting.
