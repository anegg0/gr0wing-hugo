Chris is a novelist, and a man who digs beneath the surface of things to find the meaning of humans quest. I like his answers as much as his questions.

He recently gave me the opportunity to speak about gr0wing and what I&#8217;m doing with it. I want to thank him for helping me clarify all that in an interview on his blog.

I suggest you follow his work, if you&#8217;ve been interested by my posts, chances are you&#8217;ll want to know him more.
