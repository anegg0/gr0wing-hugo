  <em style="font-weight: bold;"> A month ago I decided to stop having a day job and begin the life I really wanted.</em><br /> <strong><em>I gave back my apartment and hit the road. This is the first post of  my</em></strong><strong><em> experiment living a free, homeless life focused on <strong><em>exploring </em></strong>spirituality and <a title="About this blog" href="http://www.gr0wing.com/about-this-blog/">growing the roots of happiness</a>.<br /> I&#8217;ll post on this travel diary once a week. For 6 months.</em></strong>

**The news fell, eventually**: my company had filed bankruptcy.<!--more-->

I had just lost my job.

I had been doing well professionally for 4 years, but my luck had run out. I was officially unemployed, and if I wanted to keep up the same lifestyle, I would have to find another job.

ANOTHER JOB

Probably a &#8220;day job&#8221;.

9 to 5 and all.

Another office, with Ikea furniture&#8230;A coffee machine, colleagues around it, gossiping about people I don&#8217;t even know.

With a bit of luck my desk window would have a view that I could enjoy.

Everyday.

Hollow meetings, bullshit corporate talk. Making sure that I look OK, that I look INTERESTED.

When I don&#8217;t give a damn.

I couldn&#8217;t swallow that idea anymore, knowing that I was:

**GETTING OLDER**

At least I was sure that I was getting older, with or without a job.

Time passes, and it doesn&#8217;t care if you live a fulfilling life or if you just show up at work everyday to do something you dislike.

What about what I really liked?

What about **discovering the world, meditating, learning spirituality**…

What about traveling places with my girlfriend?

**Time was seriously running out** (I&#8217;m 39). **I decided not to let it run without me**.

I turned down all the new job offers.

I gave back the keys to my apartment.

I decided it was time to live the life I wanted.

And I left.

**BEING FREE AND HOMELESS**

As I write these lines, I&#8217;m in the middle of an experiment that I started a few weeks ago.

After saying goodbye to all my good friends in France (I&#8217;m French, BTW, if you&#8217;d like to know more about me please check it out [here][1]), I bought a plane ticket to Guatemala.

I made a deliberate choice to go to a place I&#8217;ve never been before.

I&#8217;m now **free and homeless**. I&#8217;m not poor though. I&#8217;ll tell you how I manage on a homeless budget soon :)

The following posts will be about my first steps in Latin America, beginning with a meditation retreat with [Lama Ole Nyhdal][2].

I&#8217;d be happy to stay in touch with you, if that&#8217;s also what you want:

[Friend me on the book of faces][3]

or

[Follow me on twitter][4]

Thanks :)
