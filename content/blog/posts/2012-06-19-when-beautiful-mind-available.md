### Some people are always available.

Their minds are quiet, clear, they&#8217;re open 24/7. They&#8217;re not threatened, no matter what happens.

There&#8217;s this story about a guy who put a knife under a Buddhist teacher&#8217;s throat one day. He didn&#8217;t say anything, he didn&#8217;t move, he just looked quietly at his attacker for a while until  the guy simply lowered his knife and left.

I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by this capacity to stay completely present and ready for anything to happen.

Some meditation masters of martial arts seniors have it.

But it&#8217;s usually not like that.

&nbsp;

### Nope, most people are not available at all

They&#8217;re never happy and always busy. They only think about their own problems.

It&#8217;s even fascinating how deeply some of them can drown in the seriousness of their lives. They are deeply unfunny and it&#8217;s terrible to spend dinner with them.

That&#8217;s because they only pretend to be there with you, but really, they&#8217;re somewhere else.

**Worrying**.

&nbsp;

### What about you?

How much of your attention can you afford to spend reading this article for instance?

**50%?**

#### 

Where are the other 50%?

&nbsp;

Busy?

&nbsp;

Then you and I are the same,  50% of our mind  soaks in a puddle of confused thoughts: regrets about the past and concerns about the future.

We waste of lot of ourselves focusing on things we can&#8217;t change.  
Needless to say this mindset doesn&#8217;t make us happy.

&nbsp;

However, I have stuff to share to improve that:  I&#8217;ve learned ways to make a better use of the daily mental bush.

These methods free a lot of mental garbage and give you an available mind.

You should try it, it feels really nice and it makes you more efficient at everything.

But it explains the power of availability and how to exploit it.

### What is mind availability?

Availability is what happens to your when you&#8217;re back from work and you throw yourself on the couch.

It&#8217;s the instant of release as you can finally afford to relax. Completely.

Your day&#8217;s work is done and your mind is 100% here, you&#8217;re not trying to figure what movie you&#8217;re going to watch&#8230;Yet.

It&#8217;s the beginning of the night  and there are still a lot of possibilities to spend it nicely.

Do you know that feeling? :)

Technically, you could say that an available mind is like a computer that has just restarted: it has plenty of memory available, it&#8217;s ready to start any task. It&#8217;s all potential at this stage.

That state of relaxed awareness is your best option whatever situation you&#8217;re in, here&#8217;s why:
