Last night I had a nightmare.

In my dream, I was visiting my grand parents&#8217; house (they died 5 years ago). The building was abandoned, but I entered it anyway.

&nbsp;

After visiting the hallway, I decided to take a look in their bedroom. I could sense something strange in that silence&#8230; I was not alone.

That&#8217;s when I saw my grand-father. He was THERE In the dark, sitting on the bed, watching me, and a sadistic smile was slitting his face.

I woke up to my own screams, and wondered how many other people had heard me. My girlfriend was there, terrified.

  1. <span style="line-height: 12.986111640930176px;">Accepting that it&#8217;s OK to lose control</span>
  2. Accepting that it&#8217;s OK to be ridiculous
  3. Accepting that no one cares as much as you do

I tried that, in the silence of the night, I hugged myself, and I hoped that someday everyone gets free from the trauma of nightmares and from the loneliness of pride.
