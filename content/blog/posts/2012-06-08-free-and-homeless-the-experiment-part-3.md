  <em style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;A month ago I decided to stop having a day job and hit the road.

### El Salvador: abandoned by tourism

El Salvador is my second stopover, I arrived from Guatemala by bus. Smooth ride.

There are no tourists in El Salvador.  
No wonder since the country&#8217;s famous mainly for two things:  
&#8211; A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War" target="_blank">civil war</a>  
&#8211; Two super violent gangs (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18th_Street_gang" target="_blank">MS18</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mara_Salvatrucha" target="_blank">Mara Salvatrucha</a>)<!--more-->

I guess it&#8217;s enough to repel most travelers.  
That&#8217;s too bad: this country and its people have a lot to offer, a lot more than touristic heavens like mine (France).

There are beautiful things to see there:

**Volcanoes** surrounded by multicolored vegetation  
(including wild parrots in the trees).

**Surf beaches** lost in green and rocky landscapes.

&nbsp;

That&#8217;s to name the little I saw in El Salvador.

And there&#8217;s the people, who make you feel like you belong there.  
You can&#8217;t feel like a stranger in El Salvador, even if you don&#8217;t speak the language, 5 words of spanish should be enough for people to try and help you in the streets.

Salvadorans also seem to experience stress differently: **they don&#8217;t**.  
I have no idea how they do it but as you watch people there you feel like **depression is not part of their life, either.**  
If you let yourself go with the Salvadoran flow, chances are you might forget about sadness for a while.

That doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s no suffering there, people just seem to manage it better.

And they don&#8217;t complain.

### The Dying Man

Death was&nbsp;central in my <a title="Free and homeless: the experiment – part 2" href="http://www.gr0wing.com/free-and-homeless-the-experiment-part-2/" target="_blank">last post in Guatemala</a>, unfortunately it decided to follow me in Salvador&#8217;s capital, the first step of my journey in this country.

My girlfriend Vilma and I stay at a friend&#8217;s: an old lady that lives with her husband.

The husband looks like a&nbsp;nice&nbsp;and&nbsp;warm person. Two days later we are informed that he&#8217;s just been admitted in intensive care for respiratory failure, he&#8217;s close to death.

We decide to pay him a visit, we are **madly happy about spending vacation at the hospital**, but we feel we have to contribute in some way.

They say they don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s going to make it.

He&#8217;s in a cold, isolated room. I don&#8217;t recognize the man I first met, he&#8217;s more of&nbsp;a tweaking bug now, drowning in tubes and high tech medical devices.

His eyes are open, they don&#8217;t blink, they just contract, that gives him a scary expressoin. I&#8217;m thinking:  
**&#8220;Where the hell is his conscience right now?&#8221;**  
I speak a few words, the only answers come from the drones of vital signs monitors around him. It&#8217;s not a conversation I&#8217;m having with him, anyway, more with myself.  
What do I feel, that close to someone that&#8217;s about to leave?  
I&#8217;m not so scared, maybe because I&#8217;m not the one that&#8217;s going to die.

Vilma and I come to see him three times, he&#8217;s a Buddhist, so we meditate a bit by his bed. Each time we sense some relief, maybe more for us than for him. There&#8217;s no way to know.

And he won&#8217;t speak.

### The Beach

Vilma leaves me to go back to NYC, where she lives and has a job. I decide to stay for a month in a <a href="http://www.tekuanikal.com/" target="_blank">hotel by the sea</a>.  
The place is a surfer&#8217;s paradise: god has set wave machines everywhere along the shore.  
I&#8217;m probably &nbsp;the only dude here who doesn&#8217;t surf so I&nbsp;try learning it for a week, with mild success (I nearly swallowed my board, once). My conclusion is that I&#8217;m too lazy to put the effort.

Screw it.  
I totally flake out of surfing :)

The next days I enjoy the beach, the sea, a hammock&#8230;  
That&#8217;s awesome, even at night. Sometimes waves are fluorescent because of the &#8220;Red Tide&#8221; (an accumulation of plancton in the ocean). A hypnotic thing to watch.

&nbsp;

These blissful days pass fast even though I work quite a lot (more on that below).

After several&nbsp;conversations&nbsp;with surfers, I realize that I feel closer to fish than to these people.

Surfers only care for themselves, they just want to have fun, they don&#8217;t pay attention to anything else. Fish are probably like that too, but at least they look funny.

And they won&#8217;t speak.

### The Money: how do I manage a homeless budget?

&#8220;I love your project to leave you day job and travel the world, but you&#8217;re not a student anymore, so  
**how do you make it financially?**&#8221;

That&#8217;s what a lot of people tell me.

I&#8217;m happy to share how I do it, without hiding anything.

For the reminder: I decided not to have a day job anymore, gave back the keys of my appartment and I&#8217;ve been travelling for 2 months now.

It&#8217;s not a long vacation since **I work as much as anyone**. However, I&#8217;m free to go any place and I don&#8217;t pay a rent.

I basically switched from a sedentary to a nomadic lifestyle, in which **I&nbsp;make money while I travel.**

That pays for a cozy lifestyle, not a backpacker&#8217;s one. I&#8217;m actually&nbsp;more comfortable as a traveler than I was as a sedentary person.

My activities are currently:

&#8211; **Sales in the IT industry:**

I&#8217;m an independent sales person, that allows me to generate substantial income. Although irregular, that income is enough to fuel my trip and pay the taxes :)  
Being a Sales person can allow someone to work remotely but that options needs to be earned. It took me &nbsp;4 years stuck in a 9 to 5 job before my credibility was enough to work abroad, FYI.

&#8211; **Blogger:**

I write the blog you&#8217;re just reading, it brings negligible financial value for now (this blog is 4 months old), but I expect it to be profitable within 6 months.

The transition to this nomadic lifestyle has been pure cash burn: I managed to do it &nbsp;thanks to my savings (which are all gone now) and money lend by my mom (thanks mom :-) , needless to say I recommend to have a &nbsp;minimal back up before jumping.

Regarding my current financial status, I&#8217;m now about to break even and will keep you posted as my income continues to increase :)

If you&#8217;re curious to know more on that choice, its benefits and limitations, please leave me a comment, I&#8217;ll be glad to respond.

I&#8217;d also be happy to stay in touch with you:

[Friend me on the book of faces][1]

or

[Follow me on twitter][2]

Thanks :)
