Don&#8217;t you ever fantasize on the day when you&#8217;ll leave everything behind to live a simple, spiritual life?

Dreaming of becoming a Buddhist monk or a Yogi in a meditation cave is often a mental trick to send our current problems to hell:

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li>
    <strong>Gone the bills every months:</strong> the monastery would provide.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Gone the arguments with the family and partner:</strong> celibacy would cut through relationship complications.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Gone the city, its nastiness, violence and noise:</strong> replaced with unlimited vacation in the Asian countryside.
  </li>
</ul>

Dwelling in a gorgeous place by the side of a mountain, listening to the distant humming of Buddhist rituals as you fetch water in the river…It&#8217;s a daydream I used to have.

An it&#8217;s a widely shared fantasy, judging by the number of messages and comments I&#8217;m receiving from people who&#8217;d like to abandon everything to live a religious life.

As you probably know, I actually did that when I was 26. I turned my back on the city, its challenges and its juicy promises. I left everything to become a Buddhist monk.

It felt good and it was definitely meaningful, but 10 years down the road I went back to the a normal routine, and I have no regrets about it.  
I still cherish my monastic past, but now I&#8217;m pretty sure I could have gotten the same results in a more conventional way.

In fact, there&#8217;s a lot of &#8220;monastic&#8221; rules you can start applying where you are, without turning in the keys of your apartment, I&#8217;m confident saying this because I spent the last 5 years experimenting with both asceticism in an urban environment and I think it worked out.

I started addressing this topic with a post on <a title="Urban Monks" href="http://www.gaelblanchemain.com/urban-monks/" target="_blank">Urban Monks</a>, now I&#8217;d like to share a little more on how to live like one.

So, in case you&#8217;re tempted to leave everything behind, instead of planning to settle in the Himalayas, I invite you to start now, where you are.

# Waste no time

There&#8217;s a Tibetan tale that I like, it&#8217;s blunt and cruel:

_An old man had nothing except a big bag of barley. One dark night he had hung the bag of barley above his bed to protect it from mice. Before falling asleep he thought: “I will sell this bag of barley, buy a horse, and then I will sell the horse. After I sell the horse, I will take a wife, and she will have a baby. It will be a boy. But what will I call the baby?”_  
 _As the moon rose, he suddenly thought, “I will call the boy ‘Moon’. No, actually, my boy will be so popular his name could be &#8216;More famous than the Moon&#8217; ”_

_In the meantime, as the old man was busy planning the next 20 years of his life, a mouse had nibbled the rope by which the bag of barley was hanging. The bag fell on the old man&#8217;s head and killed him instantly._

Sorry for imposing that nasty story but I like the fact that it throws the main point at your face: no matter how ambitious our projects are, our time on earth is running out on its own, regardless.

And just because years don&#8217;t come in unlimited supply, we need to set our priorities well.

I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen people trade their best years for a 20M Start Up business that never went anywhere.  
What about those who built their lives around retirement, only to hear the Doctor give them a terminal diagnosis a week after they finally paid their dues to the corporate world.

Those horrible might be your fate unless:

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li>
    <strong>You clearly know that you won&#8217;t live forever</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>You set your priorities accordingly, when it&#8217;s still time</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

If you apply the above fearlessly you&#8217;ll sort out what matters first:

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li>
    You&#8217;ll naturally want to spend more time with those you care for
  </li>
  <li>
    If there&#8217;s something you need to say to somebody, you&#8217;ll get it out of your chest asap
  </li>
  <li>
    You&#8217;ll manage to make a living out of what you love doing, for fear of waking up too late after a meaningless career
  </li>
</ul>

People diagnosed with a serious disease are often a good example of how quickly you change when you feel the countdown.  
I guess the recordings of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying" target="_blank">the most common regrets of the dying</a> also prove this point.

Buddhist Monks and Yogis are advised to keep in mind that they could die anytime. I&#8217;ve been practicing that formally for years, it definitely shifts your perspective.

When I understood that life was actually short, I dumped projects which didn&#8217;t mean enough to me: becoming a techno musician being one.

I&#8217;m aware that my time on earth might be 40 years at best and that thought brings priorities right where they belong. There&#8217;s no time for selfish or useless projects. I trash the fluff, more and more, I keep simplifying, and it feels right.

That conclusion seems to be the same for all the people I call Urban Monks.
