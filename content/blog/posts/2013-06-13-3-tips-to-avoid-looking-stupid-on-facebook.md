I could say that Facebook is evil and a waste of time (few would disagree). But I won&#8217;t.

I love Facebook, and I love to share things with my Facebook friends.

And of course I&#8217;m aware that social media websites can hand all my &#8220;personal&#8221; information to the CIA or to whoever&#8217;s wants data on my behavior when I go to the bathroom.

But will they, really? Am I that important?

Anyway, what matters to me is to make a meaningful use of Facebook, which I manage to do by applying three simple laws. I hope they help you as much as me:

## You shall not be brain-dead

When I don&#8217;t have a clear purpose for using Facebook, I end up watching a cover of Gangnam style on polka music (I might even like it and share it if I&#8217;m drunk).<!--more-->

It&#8217;s easy to be led astray by online junk, whether stupid quotes wrongly attributed to Einstein or undocumented conspirationist videos, so before landing on a social media I try to ask myself:

**&#8220;What brought me here?&#8221;  
**  
The answer is always:

  * I came here to **learn something new** and **strengthen my connection with people**

That immediately helps me skip the bulk of useless memes smeared on my timeline, and the embarrassment of sharing them.

&nbsp;

## You shall not be a spammer

**Facebook&#8217;s currency is** **attention**,  that&#8217;s why I pay attention to what my friends post, and I try to add comments that prove that I care.

I might not be fascinated by the latest picture of their nephews&#8217; drawing, but I&#8217;ll  give it a like on FB since I know what it means to them. There&#8217;s no such thing as tiny acts of kindness.

</p>

Sounds like common decency, right? Yet some FB friends completely ignore my messages and then &#8220;invite&#8221; me to like their page or come at their commercial events.

You probably know what it feels like.

That kind of spammy behavior is rewarded by **silence**, probably the worst response you can get.

In short: giving attention boosts positive connections, demanding it makes you obnoxious, on Facebook or anywhere else :)

## You shall not offend everyone

&#8220;You can make fun of anything, just not with anybody.&#8221; &#8211; Pierre Desproges

I have a doubtful sense of humor and I&#8217;d lose most of my friends if I &#8220;shared&#8221; my trashy jokes with them.  Especially as I have friends in over 30 countries.

Luckily on FB you don&#8217;t have to share everything with everyone, it&#8217;s possible to publish things that only selected friends will see, that way you don&#8217;t generate huge misunderstandings due to the cultural gaps.

If you want to make sure you address your posts to the right target, just create lists of friends:

  * those who speak your language
  * your workmates
  * those you only met online
  * your family

To do that, go to your home page to the left menu, select &#8220;Friends&#8221;, then on the the top of the page select &#8220;create a list&#8221;.

In those lists, put whoever can be the right recipient for specific kinds posts.

Now when you&#8217;ll post something, you&#8217;ll have the option to select who should see your particular post (on the example below, I selected the &#8220;Unshockables&#8221;, the ones that will never be deterred by my bad taste.)

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5858" alt="unshockables" src="http://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/unshockables1.jpg" width="575" height="180" srcset="https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/unshockables1.jpg 575w, https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/unshockables1-300x93.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /> 

That won&#8217;t prevent the CIA from checking out everything you do, but I&#8217;m sure you know that already :)
