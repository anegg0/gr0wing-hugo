<p style="background-color: silver;">
  I&#8217;ve arrived in New York.<br /> This city doesn&#8217;t care about me.
</p>

It&#8217;s 10 PM.

The night has swallowed the only naturally occurring thing in New York: sunlight.

Raging traffic, people walking everywhere. I don&#8217;t even exist here, my presence is insignificant, like a bug&#8217;s fart.<!--more-->

&nbsp;

I could stay in the airport&#8217;s hall for a week, nobody would pay attention.

I could lie on the ground and die right before the entrance, nobody would care as much as their next business meeting.

The airport has probably a team dedicated to people dying in the main hall, so I guess they would come pick me up, and that would be it.

While there&#8217;s something cold and totally impersonal in airports, I like that feeling of anonymity.

New York has plenty of anonymity. So much anonymity that it&#8217;s easy to drown in it.

After two months in Latin America, I&#8217;ve has plenty of time to go unnoticed, so I&#8217;m glad to leave the airport and be welcomed by my girlfriend, at her apartment in Queens.

Next post will be about next to nothing :)
