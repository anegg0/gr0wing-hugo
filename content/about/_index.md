My name is Gaël Blanchemain, I've spent the last 20 years walking unconventional paths to transform myself and try to figure who I am and what I can do to make a difference. For instance, I became a Buddhist monk for 10 years and I also experimented a lot with psychedelics.

I love inner exploration, self improvement, ecology, web development and I set out to change the world. I write about these passions and I learn every day from all the people that connect with me.

I'm a French-man who lives in the US. I'm also a self-improvement junkie and I love to inspire and get inspired by others.

Since I was twenty (I'm 42 now), I've invested most of my time digging in self-help methods and spiritual traditions.

I was driven by the belief that, even though a human's life can be extremely hard, our resources are enough to eradicate problems and limitations. Included global ones.

And I've encountered problems and limitations: a dysfunctional family, several fits of depression and the self-esteem of a washed-up wrestler.

Doing drugs was one of my first responses to face the pressure and absurdity of a life without spirituality. Although chemicals did provide some insights, they mainly pointed the way toward healthier strategies.

I then turned to meditation and started practicing intensively in a [Buddhist Center](http://www.dhagpo-kagyu-ling.org/en/), I actually loved that so much that I became a Buddhist monk for 10 years.

That was an awesome opportunity to learn meditation with qualified Masters and study the Buddhist path most of my time. I often mention the [time I spent with Khenchen Rinpoche](http://www.gr0wing.com/free-and-homeless-the-experiment-part-15/#more-3676) learning from him and translating his teachings.

After ten years, though, I felt I was running in circles, I needed to grow beyond that religious frame, so I decided to give back my monk's vows and returned to a normal lifestyle in 2008.

Since then, I met Vilma, my beautiful wife, who gives me all the love that I need (wrapped in enough intelligence to make life meaningful and fun).

I work in the IT area for a living, practice yoga, meditation and a lot of others methods that I talk about on this website.

There's still so much more I want to say... I'll keep sharing it post by post.

I hope to [count you in my connections](http://eepurl.com/zxyeT) soon :)
