I&#8217;ve just spent a few days in a Buddhist retreat center with the coolest human beings on earth.

I&#8217;m calling them cool because these guys are nice to be around and also because making them mad is unbelievably difficult.  
They take their cool everywhere with them, it&#8217;s floating around, you could almost touch it.

I&#8217;ve already tried to make these guys angry, just for the sake of challenging myself and I always failed miserably.

</div>

There&#8217;s Khenchen Rinpoche, 84 (although nobody&#8217;s too sure about his age), He&#8217;s a meditation master, and the type who&#8217;s so mentally stable that he would not budge if you pulled a machine-gun to his face.

I&#8217;ve actually lived close to him for two years and I NEVER saw him angry. Not even when I served him one of my experimental dishes (in my home town, people get killed for less than that).

&nbsp;

Then there&#8217;s Phurba, <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Tibetan too, I witnessed him getting slightly upset once as he hung up on some dude,</span> but the guy he was arguing with truly deserved to be executed with a chainsaw, so I&#8217;d say that Phurba handled the conflict with style.

    Left to right: Phurba, Daniel and Hunter
  </p>
</div>

There&#8217;s Daniel, who spends most of his time traveling around the world, as I&#8217;m writing he just got his main suitcase stolen in the train. So far he didn&#8217;t complain over his loss which includes several Teras of data and a lot of his video editing work.

When it comes to Hunter, his self-control makes me jealous, so I insidiously try to push him over the edge, but then he makes fun of me and I end up doubting my capacities to be a sore in the ass.

I find it pretty awesome to watch those four guys operate, they look so immune to the anxiety that plagues modern minds.

Although they come from various backgrounds, they have a few interesting things in common, let me summarize what they&#8217;re doing differently:

## They don&#8217;t own much

Even the most extreme minimalistic Ayatollahs look like hoarders and hypocrites if I compare them to my friends.

Phurba owns a camera, a laptop and a few clothes. That&#8217;s it. Earlier in his life he crossed Tibet (a fairly large country by human standards) with next to nothing.

Daniel had two bags, but as I said earlier, he got the second one stolen, so now he&#8217;ll do with just one.

None of my buds appear to be in distress for not owning much. In fact, their happiness looks more genuine than the staged smiles of a life insurance commercial.

Simplicity seems to alleviate pressure, the equation is very simple: your stress level decreases as you get rid of more junk.

So far I praised my friends who chose frugality, but I also know people on the opposite side of the wealth spectrum: they own beautiful houses by the mediterranean sea or the French countryside and their lives are a tragic proof of how miserable and paranoid riches can make you. These folks complain non-stop about the astronomical cost of their properties maintenance and  their struggle with the fear of being taken advantage of.

My point is not to advocate poverty, I just believe that wealth and happiness have a shitty relationship and that they should divorce.

And the four friends I mentioned as example are not poor, two of them are Buddhist monks (their needs are covered by their spiritual organization) and the two others are successful freelancers. <a title="Happiness is in the trashcan" href="http://www.gr0wing.com/happiness-trashcan/" target="_blank">They just have enough</a>.

## Rolling in the present

When is that scam going to end?

When will we get it that the past and the future are mental constructs designed to hypnotize us into a vegetable state?

All that we&#8217;ll ever have is **right now**, either you get this idea right, or you sign a life-long commitment with anxiety. The outcome is pretty straightforward: those who understand how to enjoy the present moment spend a pretty darn good time on earth, the others are always busy scheduling a future that never happens while ignoring every minute they could actually experience.

I&#8217;m just like the majority of sleep-walkers, I always secretly hope tomorrow will be kinder with me than yesterday and less annoying than just now.  
But I&#8217;m aware of the terrible cost of not enjoying the present while it&#8217;s there, so I exercise the power of now daily.

In this regard, I&#8217;m afraid the dudes I mentioned seem much more adjusted to the present.

They&#8217;re not into death sports or hard drugs, instead they taught themselves how to be right here, right now which seems to keep anxiety at bay.

## The others

Last anxiety crusher I&#8217;d like to mention: altruism.

Now please be honest and <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">just admit that altruism is</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> a corny and boring concept, a bitter remedy that you hate. If you feel you like it then I&#8217;d bet you haven&#8217;t really tried yet. </span>

Helping others is not cool unless you&#8217;re in a commercial for UNICEF, in real life it&#8217;s a drag and usually you have to do it in the worst possible times: like getting a desperate call from a friend who argued with his bipolar fiance when you had planned to watch a erotic movie.

Taking care of others is not popular, it&#8217;s never been exciting to be kind because I think we&#8217;re all hard-wired to not give a fig about our peers.

No wonder the spiritual figures who promoted selflessness have been misunderstood or ended on a cross somewhere in the desert.

Even the spiritual revival that&#8217;s happening today around meditation hardly mentions altruism, because the concept is such a turn-off, it makes sales plummet instantly. It&#8217;s like trying to convince the world to regain health by getting a daily enema, the majority would rather be sick.

But once again, the four men I mentioned above had no problem wrapping their heads around the importance of caring for others.

I&#8217;m not sure if they do it spontaneously or just because they&#8217;re Buddhist, but everytime I spend time with them, they&#8217;re ready to help and seem more interested in me than the average Joes I deal with in NYC.

I can&#8217;t resist sharing a picture of Khenchen Rinpoche feeding birds. He does it not because he likes it, but because he thinks that winter is tough on animals:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7653" alt="Khenchen-rinpoche-feeding-bird" src="http://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Khenchen-rinpoche-feeding-bird.jpg" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Khenchen-rinpoche-feeding-bird.jpg 600w, https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Khenchen-rinpoche-feeding-bird-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> 

Owing less, living in the moment, helping others&#8230; Is that all I had to say? Yep. I know, it&#8217;s nothing new, but my hunch is that it&#8217;s the only way that truly works.

I  know that there are other more targeted methods: sleeping enough, a healthy diet and healthy relationships but articles about mental fitness tend to annoy me, and on top of that I know too many people who apply these superficial tricks without any results whatsoever.

There is no herbal supplement to treat anxiety, it&#8217;s a daily job, but looking at a few examples, It seems to be reachable.
