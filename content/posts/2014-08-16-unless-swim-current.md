Mainstream culture expects you to be an imbecile because stupidity makes you the best recipient for viral messages, commercials and war propaganda.

In a way, you&#8217;d rather be an idiot too, they say ignorance is blissful, right? Even if it&#8217;s not, it alleviates the burden of responsibility. I&#8217;m no different.

That mainstream waterslide of brain numbness and lower human values leaves no choice to those who want to grow but:

  * Being an example
  * Questioning every media (more specifically those that question media)
  * Lead the global conversation toward empathy

Unless you swim against the current, reality TV reshapes human society, one program at a time.
