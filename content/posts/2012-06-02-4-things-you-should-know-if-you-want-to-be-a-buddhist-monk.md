Ever thought about leaving everything behind and become a Buddhist monk?

Have you, at some stage in your life, felt inspired by devoting yourself to meditation and helping others?<!--more-->

I&#8217;m always happy when I hear that someone is considering to walk that path. It can be a unique way to deepen one&#8217;s understanding and  to help people.

However, let me share a few things I learned on the way (I was a Tibetan buddhist monk for 10 years). I summarized them in 4 tips that you might want to consider before making a decision.

Here are 4 important aspects of a monk&#8217;s life, I&#8217;ll start with the rough ones. If you are a woman considering to become a nun, the very same applies.

&nbsp;

### Personal tranquility? Just forget it.

The mass media has fed us pictures of serene meditators, facing gorgeous Himalayan landscapes.

You&#8217;ll probably have moments like that if you chose to become a monk, but that&#8217;s the icing on the cake.

No, seriously, you&#8217;re going to be busy. Very busy. Probably busier than you&#8217;ve ever been:  
&#8211; **Taking care of people** (a lot of lost souls end up in Buddhist environments)  
&#8211; **Organizing everything** (teachings, religious events, accounting, I even worked on computers)  
&#8211; **Washing the dishes**  
&#8211; **Cleaning the monastery**

And that&#8217;s on a 24/7 basis, no vacation (or hardly ever), no WE. Your retreat will  be limited to a small room in which you&#8217;ll probably be solicited at anytime.

So, it&#8217;s advisable to **forget about personal tranquility&#8230;And intimacy along with it**.

Still inspired?

OK:

### Girls, girls, girls&#8230;.

As a Buddhist monk, you&#8217;ll take the vow of chastity (unless you become a Zen monk). It means you&#8217;ll renounce having sex. No sex, not even on your own.

For guys, that&#8217;s usually a challenge (and for girls too, when they become nuns).

_Why would someone choose not to have sex?_

Because all the time you don&#8217;t spend doing it is reinvested in your meditation and yoga practice. That&#8217;s often well worth it.

It also changes your perception of desire, **you generally discover that it&#8217;s not what you think**. Many people learn a lot about themselves through chastity, they get very intimate with their true identity.

Most westerners decide to switch back to a lay life after a while, but it&#8217;s usually an experience that makes them more mature and self reliable.

In Thailand, a lot of women will refuse to date a guy if he hasn&#8217;t been a monk for  at least three months (that&#8217;s a tradition there). They would be scared to be with a guy that can&#8217;t get a hold of himself.

I&#8217;ll probably get some hate mail on this topic, but I can take it, I am talking out of my experience, here, and sexuality has never been a problem for me.

### Right environment + right guidance

If you&#8217;d like to become a monk, you need to choose your community well, because that&#8217;s all you&#8217;re going to have. You will officially renounce having a family.

You&#8217;ll live in a monastery or at least among your peers, THEY&#8217;ll be your family.

Needless to say that since you can choose them, it&#8217;s wise to investigate before jumping into a spiritual community.

A Buddhist monk also needs to rely on some spiritual guidance, often incarnated by a master.

That guide had better be good, otherwise he might mislead you. If the guy (or gal) is wacked out or in a power trip, you&#8217;re in bad trouble. This part is critical.

All the more critical as **there are lots of psychopaths that choose to be Gurus**, they&#8217;re often successful at that and hard to identify ([this might be helpful if you have doubts][1]).

At this point, if you&#8217;re still not discouraged, the below is within your reach.

### Moments of grace

&nbsp;

As a monk, as a guy that has abandoned worldly concerns, **you&#8217;ll have peaceful moments**, some will stretch endlessly.

**You&#8217;ll build areas of inner peace**, and they will be yours for the long run.

**You&#8217;ll meet outstanding persons, accomplished masters**.

**You&#8217;ll gain something inside that nobody will steal from you**.

As for many other things:  personal experience is probably the best way to know if that choice is right for you.

If you&#8217;re inspired by the monk path and you&#8217;d like to try, you can experience a sample of it. Some Buddhist schools offer to give vows for a very limited time (a day, for instance).

See how it works with your personality, whatever choice you make in your life: lay person or monk, walking the monastic path for a while will help you know yourself much better.
