You&#8217;ve been running too much, you&#8217;ve outdone yourself.

Don&#8217;t you feel exhausted?

<!--more-->

All those struggles, for dreams, for promises.

While your  life is running out, certainly.  
Please give yourself a break, this time, stop for a moment.  
And <span style="font-size: 16px;">breathe</span>.

There&#8217;s never been a better time to stop.

Drop all your ambitions, leave them at the door if you can.

Please.

<span style="font-size: 16px;">You owe yourself a break</span>, this is serious business, more serious than a thousand position openings.

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 14px;">Wasting time is OK</span>, go ahead, death will forgive.

&nbsp;

How does it feel to do nothing,  
Without any label attached to it?  
Without justification?

&nbsp;

The economy can wait, because some things come for free.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Like this moment.
