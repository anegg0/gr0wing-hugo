Hi everyone,

this is a quick post to proudly announce that I&#8217;ve been interviewed by Vaibhav Wankhede on his travel blog <a href="http://www.leavingmyfootprint.com/travel/interview-gael-blanchemain/" target="_blank">Leaving My Footprints</a>.

Vaibhav was curious about my &#8220;<a href="http://www.gaelblanchemain.com/free-and-homeless-part-1/" target="_blank">Free and Homeless Experiment</a>&#8221; and has kindly shared our QA session in <a href="http://www.leavingmyfootprint.com/travel/interview-gael-blanchemain/" target="_blank">this post</a>.

I encourage you to follow his blog, which should be a source of inspiration for all those contemplating to go for a long trip and coach surfing.
