And they&#8217;re hard to control, that&#8217;s why people keep doing them until they die. That&#8217;s also why the war on drugs is a useless (and tragic) comedy show.

TV says drugs are evil, yet my  neighbor claims they&#8217;re the food of the gods. Through the extremes of veneration and hatred dope always attracts the wrong attention, like a teenage girl wearing too much make up. We just lack the maturity to handle it well.

  * On a global level, we cannot solve the problem by trying to pluck drugs out of society, blaming a molecule makes little sense. Instead, why not do the hard labor of understanding why so many of us are left with no other exit strategy than snorting ourselves numb?
  * On a personal level, whatever drugs you&#8217;re considering: why not RTFM before doing it? (<a href="https://www.erowid.org/" target="_blank">Read The F***ing Manual</a>).  That would help more than watching yet another spooky documentary about the latest chemical plague.

There&#8217;s no way out until you know why you do what you do, and own the consequences, then I suppose drugs can become a spiritual path.
