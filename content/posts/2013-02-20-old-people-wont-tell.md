Unless you ask them.

&nbsp;

They have 80% of the information you need to succeed.

What works… what doesn&#8217;t:

&#8211; Relationships  
&#8211; Business  
&#8211; Dealing with financial challenges&#8230;

<!--more-->

Old people did all that long before you did, and their conclusions are clearly laid out in their minds.  
I&#8217;m talking about practical, solid knowledge, things that you can use right now, not bogus quotes on Facebook.

Old men don&#8217;t know anything about fashion and the latest LOLcats social media trends, but they have valuable data in store.

Save time and steal their insights.

They&#8217;re generally glad to share it anyway, and they won&#8217;t charge.

Of course, marketers don&#8217;t want you to do that, they&#8217;d rather sell you a book, or an online course.

Western society has been busy increasing the gap between the old and the young, just because it&#8217;s convenient:  
now people feel they have to purchase the knowledge they could get for free.

If you find it corny to tap into old people&#8217;s life experience, you can still ask GOOGLE, but search engines are packed with guys anxious to sell you their answers. And they&#8217;re your age, they don&#8217;t know more than you do (I&#8217;m probably your age).

Your presence on this website proves that you know you can&#8217;t figure out everything on your own, the good thing is there&#8217;s enough old men who&#8217;ve done what you&#8217;re doing now: building a successful life.

They came out with real answers.

You shouldn&#8217;t waste time on this blog. Instead, spending an hour with a retired CEO would be a good thing to try.
