  <strong>Traveling brings you home. That&#8217;s what it does to me.</strong>

### The world is my apartment.

I started my homeless experiment three months ago. My goal was to travel the world while earning an income.<!--more-->

###<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3315" title="Earth" src="http://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/earth-241x300.jpg" alt="" width="241" height="300" srcset="https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/earth-241x300.jpg 241w, https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/earth.jpg 386w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" /> 

I can honestly say that it has been a success so far and I&#8217;m happy about it. I really like to discover places and people.

I used to avoid travelling before, thinking that immobility meant security.

There&#8217;s nothing to be afraid of: my comfort zone can be as big as the planet I live on, at least I&#8217;m sure of that, now.

So the first side-effect of this experiment is a sense of confidence and enthusiasm.

Sounds like a great place to start from, doesn&#8217;t it?

The world is definitely worth visiting, and opting out of a sedentary lifestyle can be a fulfilling choice.  
On the way, I identified several benefits of being nomadic:

&#8211; **You eat different everyday**  
&#8211; **You change neighbors often**  
&#8211; **You discover the world and its inhabitants** &#8211; So nice!  
&#8211; **You learn new languages** and mindsets  
&#8211; **You spot new jobs**/business opportunities  
&#8211; **Your challenge old certainties**: makes it harder to become stiff

Now, here&#8217;s the downside of roaming around:

&#8211; **You&#8217;re often exhausted**: jet-lag, constant transits, food adaptation  
&#8211; **Security is not guaranteed**, check the <a title="Free and homeless: the experiment – part 5" href="http://www.gr0wing.com/free-homeless-experiment-part-5/" target="_blank">machete attack post</a>  
&#8211; **You never know who you&#8217;re dealing with**  
&#8211; **You spend money**, even in crappy hotels  
&#8211; **You need a lot of self-discipline to get your job done** (that&#8217;s if you earn an income, like me)  
&#8211; **Governments don&#8217;t like nomads**:  
they will try to nail your feet to the ground with nonsense paperwork

But even after summing that up, I still recommend testing that lifestyle. Even if at some stage you decide to settle somewhere and be sedentary again.

There&#8217;s another side effect I&#8217;ve noticed since I started this experiment:

### There&#8217;s no Interzone

When you travel, you usually differentiate two things:

&#8211; **Your destination**: the place where you want to go  
&#8211; **The Interzone**: the distance you need to travel to get there (term stolen from William Burroughs)

That&#8217;s your idea of a trip when you&#8217;re sedentary: you&#8217;re either "traveling" or you have "arrived at your destination".

Yet, after a few months in planes, buses and trains you can&#8217;t make those distinctions anymore.  Your mind stops labeling places as destinations or stop overs. You can&#8217;t even remember where you are when you wake up.

You don&#8217;t get bored in a transit flight.  
You&#8217;re not disappointed if the place you visit looks like crap.  
If you like it by the side of the road, because there&#8217;s a lake, you just stop there and enjoy the view.

Everything becomes worthy of your attention.

Everywhere is a destination, and it&#8217;s always temporary.

I guess it&#8217;s just a mind shift, but it&#8217;s really enjoyable, I hope I keep that with me. It&#8217;s incredibly relaxing not to worry about where you are.

I didn&#8217;t say much about latin america this time, I hope you don&#8217;t mind :)

I&#8217;d be happy to stay in touch with you, if you didn&#8217;t befriend me already: [Friend me on the book of faces][1] or [Follow me on twitter][2]  Thanks :)
