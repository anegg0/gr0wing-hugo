<p style="background-color: silver;">
  Before dawn.
</p>

It&#8217;s 5:30 AM.

&nbsp;

Even New York  manages to be quiet at this time.<!--more-->

&nbsp;

The city tries to be discreet, not to disturb the moments preceeding dawn.

I&#8217;m sure it respects early risers.

This is a time of peace, and I love it.

&nbsp;

I <a href="http://www.gr0wing.com/meet-your-raw-power/" target="_blank">meditate</a> and work (usually [from my bed][1]).

&nbsp;

I listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBenfMd8jsc&list=FLIXHVJWZxcdqhsrOtafR6MA&feature=mh_lolz" target="_blank">ambient music</a>, it feeds my mind the right nutrients.

&nbsp;

I try to communicate with others, as I write posts.

&nbsp;

Becoming homeless has given me so much time to work on this blog.  Since I don&#8217;t have a day job anymore, I spend more and more time writing posts.

I&#8217;m only starting to understand that there are  people reading it: YOU :)

&nbsp;

The positive feedback I get from readers makes me confident that somewhere, someone will read me. That makes my day.

&nbsp;

BTW, I removed all ads from my blog, they looked terrible and they&#8217;ve paid me&#8230;.**3$** in 6 month so far.

I&#8217;ve also decided to <a title="Uncopyright" href="http://www.gr0wing.com/uncopyright/" target="_blank">uncopyright</a> all the content of my website.

&nbsp;

That&#8217;s such a relief: no ads, no lawyers, NO WORRIES!

I&#8217;m more and more willing to give away whatever I do on this blog (I&#8217;ll find a way for my readers to contribute if they want to).

How could I praise generosity, patience and other values if I plaster my site with marketing garbage, anyway?

&nbsp;

Next post will be about my stay at a Buddhist center Upstate New York. Expect sex, violence and power struggles.
