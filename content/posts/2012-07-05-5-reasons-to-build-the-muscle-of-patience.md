#### "Patience is also a form of action."  ~Auguste Rodin

I used to think that patience was for the lazy, the passive, the last option when everything else has failed.

I changed my mind since and I became a huge fan of this quality.

Patience is actually the greatest source of happiness and power.<!--more-->

  
It opens the doors to nearly everything.

Here&#8217;s a definition for patience:

**Patience is the capacity to deal with any situation in order to reach your goals, it&#8217;s what empowers you to c****ope with a problem until it&#8217;s solved****.**

I chose to run through five benefits of patience:

### PATIENCE MAKES YOU STRONG

Patience makes you capable of dealing with virtualy any situation. It&#8217;s the black belt of every martial art.

Being patient shows your strength and makes you stronger in the same time: it&#8217;s an empowering loop.

Think about body building: each time you lift heavier weights you increase your muscle mass. The same goes for patience: : each time you choose to be patient, you increase your ability to deal with problems. When the next difficulty shows up, you&#8217;re stronger and you respond better.

In some cultures, though, anger and agression are often presented as a sign of force. I don&#8217;t know how this belief still survives: nothing is weaker and more pathetic than an angry person: they jerk randomly while talking nonsense and when their moment of upset wears off they regret most of what they did.

**You have to be seriously retarded to believe that anger will make you look strong**. Patience, on the other hand, forces anyone&#8217;s respect and makes situations bend to your will.

### PATIENCE MAKES YOU HAPPY

By practicing patience, you don&#8217;t let anything take your happiness away from you. You decide that you will be happy no matter freaking what.  
**That mental process is a bullet-proof shield against frustrations** and every adverse circumstances.

A lot of westerners report seeing more happy people in developing countries that in rich nations. That&#8217;s because people in poor places have mastered this quality of joyful acceptance, they have no other choice.

They don&#8217;t wait for things to get better in order to be happy, we shouldn&#8217;t waste time either.

### PATIENCE MAKES YOU SMART

"Smart people are not hurried. Hurried people are not smart" &#8211; Chinese proverb.

When you decide to be patient, you give your mind the time to think clearly about a situation. You don&#8217;t let your emotions take over and decide for you.

**Being patient creates the space and the ground that your intelligence needs to develop**.

I&#8217;m sure you know that already: impatient people excel at the art of making fools of themselves publicly and engaging in incoherent course of actions…

### PATIENCE MAKES YOU SUCCESSFUL

Most goals are not achieved overnight. It takes time to bust all the obstacles on the way to success.  
**Patience is the fuel you need to succeed**: it&#8217;s no rocket fuel that evaporate after a quick surge, but diesel that will get you across the state on a single tank. It&#8217;s the ability to keep your energy steady, regardless of the time and effort required.

Once you have identified that quality in you (you have it, even if you think you don&#8217;t) you become unstoppable.

### PATIENCE MAKES YOU LOVABLE

In Tibetan patience and tolerance are the same word. I think Tibetans really nailed it: patience indeed gives you the ability to be tolerant with people, to accept them as they are.

The consequence of applying tolerance is that everybody feels good with you, especially your partner.

Who wouldn&#8217;t love somebody that is peaceful and accepts them, with their shortcomings?  
Patience is probably the best social lubricant, no matter what gender or personality type you&#8217;re  trying to connect with, you can use it without any moderation.

What&#8217;s even greater: this sense of tolerance works just as well with yourself, being patient also allows you to work with your problems and be committed to intelligently deal with them until they&#8217;re completely solved.

**Wherever there is patience, there is love, for you and the people around you. **

&nbsp;

**Was this convincing enough?**

I hope it was!

If it takes you time to start using patience, it&#8217;s OK. That&#8217;s part of the process.

I personally chose not to give myself any excuse to loose patience, but of course I blow a fuse at least 3 times a week :)
