    <span class="s1">I have a problem. If you’re about forty, you have it too: you&#8217;re getting old. And it sucks or at least a large part of it sucks. For the sake of journalistic integrity, I&#8217;ll start with what sucks and then I&#8217;ll share the good part about having one foot in the grave.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">1- What’s NOT cool about getting old:</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">Ageing has already stolen quite a lot from me, like:</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"><b>My FACE</b></span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">I look hung over, except I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m just a dude who&#8217;s worked for 25 + years and now it really fucking shows. When I don&#8217;t work, I&#8217;m busy growing a beer belly and undiagnosed cancer.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"><b>My teeth</b></span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">They are falling apart and my bad breath hangs in there, for some reason, it refuses to leave. I recently caught a young head hunter taking a step backwards when I was talking about&#8230;Stuff.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"><b>My elbows</b></span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">They&#8217;re so squishy that my daughter hang on to them, like handles, when we&#8217;re in the subway. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"><b>My potential in the job market</b></span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">The last time I attended a job interview, the co-founder called me “Sir” and then he tried to intimidate me with weird questions. He was about 25, some of my underwear is older (and dirtier) than him, so the whole meeting felt like a weird episode of South Park. He didn&#8217;t call me back.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"><b>My sex appeal</b></span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">Not sure I ever had any, but one thing’s clear by now: if I did, it&#8217;s GONE.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"><b>My ability to socialize</b></span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">This has always been an issue because I still resent the human race and it shows on my facial expressions. Now you&#8217;re going to tell me that these issues have nothing to do with age but I disagree. Being 40+ can cause issues with your  peers. For instance:  I feel envious of millenials, of their freedom and their youth and their&#8230;. and so I keep my distance.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">I&#8217;m sometimes forced to speak with people my own age about shitty topics like young kids I don&#8217;t give a toss for, vacations and whatnot and I don&#8217;t give a damn about all that crap. As a consequence, you can imagine that solitude is by far my preferred option (even more so if you factor-in my zombie breath).</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">OK, now now what’s good about getting old:</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"><b>People call you “Sir"</b></span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">Hell yeah! Isn&#8217;t that sweet? When they see your old mug at the door, employees behave. You’re their boss’s age after all. And even if you know that being older doesn’t make you special in any way, you find comfort in abusing people&#8217;s fear of the old Alpha-male.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"><b>You meditate more</b></span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">An you meditate deeper, longer. You carry the holy spiritual fire in you! That’s because  you’ve had plenty of opportunities to struggle with the smelly parts of life:</span>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li class="p1">
      <span class="s1">Crappy romances</span>
    </li>
    <li class="p1">
      <span class="s1">Ego-driven projects that fail miserably</span>
    </li>
    <li class="p1">
      <span class="s1">Betrayed friendships</span>
    </li>
    <li class="p1">
      <span class="s1">Horrible disappointments with family members (cheap pun intended)</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">At this stage, you&#8217;re ready to go to a desert </span><span class="s2">and do away with the whole</span> <span class="s2">human life deception!</span><span class="s1">  You might not yet be Yoda, but you kind of sense what&#8217;s good for you: meditating, sitting your ass in the present and relaxing.<br /> </span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"><b>You enjoy free stuff</b></span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">When you’re broke and old like me, simple stuff satisfies you.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">Anything relaxing will do like a walk in the park, a nap with the cat or the second season of a Korean series that you’ll never finish watching…and all that good stuff is free!</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">How immensely satisfying to frolic in meadows whilst the 20 something crowd struggles with a toxic mix of boredom and ambition.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"><b>You take no shit</b></span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">You used to be intimated by debt collectors, landlords and weed dealers but not anymore. With age, you’ve learned to fight back.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">There&#8217;s no spooking you now. Administrations, businesses and even your own family no longer pose a threat to you! You’ve been kicked so many times that the skin of your behind is as thick as a rhino’s magnificent derrière.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">“Just bring it on!” you think, be it to nasty taxi drivers or hustlers of any kind. The world can still try to bully you but now you&#8217;re on the right side of the gun and you don&#8217;t take no shit no more".</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"><b>You enjoy returning favors</b></span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">I’m talking about repaying your parents, for instance. They used to feed you and they gave you the best education they could. Now, they are quietly walking out of this life, weakened physically and emotionally whilst you are at the peak of your strengths; well almost peak.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">It&#8217;s time to parent your own parents and finally do something for them. Boy, that feels right; particularly now that you can protect them from scams, aggressive neighbors and other vultures.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1"><b>You appreciate everyone’s qualities</b></span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">That’s a blanket statement and I know it sounds like I&#8217;m sugar coating reality but I&#8217;m not.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">Some bizarre chemical process takes place in an ageing brain; all of a sudden, most women look beautiful and young people seem to radiate intelligence and kindness.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">Go figure what makes me more receptive to other people&#8217;s qualities when I used to loathe mankind so much.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">This leads me to wonder how come I spent the first 20 years of my life surrounded by ugly chicks and moronic colleagues? What was skewed in my perceptions? I guess that magical pill worked.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">Now here I am and here you are. Our sagging bodies tell it all before we open our mouths. Most commercials are designed for people younger than us but from here on, a strange kind of freedom starts rising like a morning star, and wondrous things become possible such as newly acquired freedoms.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">Benefiting from the bitter lessons of adulthood, we grow and flourish like some exotic and delicate plants. I know it&#8217;s often called maturity but I didn&#8217;t expect it to be this blissful. Did you?</span>
