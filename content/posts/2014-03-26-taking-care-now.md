Of course you can worry about the future, you&#8217;ve been trained enough to do that, but who&#8217;s going to look after your present?

Who&#8217;s going to breathe, and walk, and eat that sandwich, while you&#8217;re busy thinking about your next job interview?  
Is your body just a machine in charge of keeping you alive, or something that needs intimacy with your consciousness, right now?

The priority is ours to define: but we have one mind only, enjoying our life can&#8217;t be done while pondering about tomorrow.

I&#8217;m not bringing solutions, there might be none. Maybe it&#8217;s simply not possible to be mindful of the present with the  pressure and the economic conditions imposed on us.

If so, isn&#8217;t it a strong warning that our society is unhealthy and needs a change?

There&#8217;s a reason why genuine spirituality doesn&#8217;t fit well in the Status Quo: there&#8217;s something revolutionary about it, but the change still needs to come from us.
