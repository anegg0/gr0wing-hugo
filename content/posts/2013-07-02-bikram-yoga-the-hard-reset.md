The class was led by a dictatorial teacher, in an over-heated room. I spent 90 minutes struggling for my survival, drenched in sweat, ended up on my hands and knees in a state of shock, nearly puked myself.

But then I tried again, god knows why I’m so stubborn.

Three years down the road I became sort of addicted to this  controversial form of Yoga, especially thanks to <a href="http://www.bikramyogamarseille.com/eng/index-eng.html" target="_blank">Corinne and her great crew.</a>

Bikram Yoga is tough, painful, repetitive and everybody hates Bikram Choudhury, the man who created it. Yet his fast-food-like Yoga healed people, it’s healing me, for instance. If you’re curious to try, please do, you might love it or HATE it, but I don’t think you’ll waste your time.

And for those in the middle of a life crisis, it might be an opportunity to reset everything top bottom using that last chance treatment.

Let me tell you what to expect before your first Bikram class:

## Cons

  * <span style="line-height: 12.997159004211426px;"><strong>It&#8217;s expensive. </strong>Count $20/class.</span>
  * **The beginning feels terrible.** A bit like being trapped in a barrel sitting in the death valley at 4 pm. Very nice.
  * **Some teachers are obnoxious little Hitlers.** And they believe being tough helps you get better.
  * **It&#8217;s exhausting.** I can&#8217;t think of something more tiring than a Bikram yoga session.
  * **It smells bad.** Sometime, my Bikram outfits&#8217; odor reminds me of moldy cottage cheese stuffed into a dead raccoon.

## Pros

  * **It cleanses your body.** Flushes the kidneys and liver, amazingly efficient if you&#8217;ve done drugs or alcohol in the past.
  * **It beats depression.** Including severe forms, Bikram would uplift you even if you were on the death row.
  * **It forces you into a healthy lifestyle.** You feel drawn to eat vegetables. Smoking loses its appeal.
  * **It fixes joints problem.** I&#8217;ve seen people with serious form of arthritis have a normal life thanks to Bikram yoga.
  * **It buffs you up.** Makes you gain muscle and lose excess fat.
  * **It helps with meditation.** Bikram poses require a high level of focus which is helpful for Mindfulness practice.

&nbsp;

Now if you&#8217;re still in the mood for a try:

## Before you get started

####  DOs

  * **Tolerate the pain.** Your efforts WILL pay within the first two weeks, hold on for at least two weeks.
  * **Aim for the long run.** Don&#8217;t pry your knees open trying to achieve a stretching  pose right away. Give yourself some time.
  * **Take breaks if you need to.** Once again, better go slow and steady than be hysterical for a month and then quit. During the course, sit and rest if you need to. If the teachers forbids it: take off.
  * **Breathe.** I thought I knew how to breathe until I nearly choked up in a Bikram class. Breathe deep, seriously.
  * **Use your club&#8217;s clean towel service**. As said above, you don&#8217;t want to carry your smelly stuff around.
  * **Drink all through the day.** It&#8217;s hard to believe how dehydrated you&#8217;ll get after a Bikram session.

&nbsp;

#### DON&#8217;Ts

  * **Don&#8217;t play Superman. **If you&#8217;re a guy, save your energy to make it through the 90mn of class, play it smooth.
  * **Don&#8217;t come with an aerobic outfit.** Unless you&#8217;d like to commit suicide by heat. A brief is just fine.
  * **Don&#8217;t show late.** Come early enough in the class so you can take a cool spot and warm-up in the room.
  * **Don&#8217;t confuse Bikram with its teachers .** Some neurotic teachers never open windows and praise the "No Pain, No Gain" approach. Chose another instructor if you don&#8217;t like to be in the army, there&#8217;s plenty of ways to teach Bikram Yoga, some will match your personality type. Be patient and keep going.
  * **Don&#8217;t pay attention to the Bikram polemic.** It doesn&#8217;t matter what Bikram says (he&#8217;s provocative) or how old Yoga lovers consider him. If his style works for you, that should be good enough.

&nbsp;

If you&#8217;ve already tried Bikram Yoga, I&#8217;m curious to know what you&#8217;ve gone through when you started, can you share that  in the below? Thanks :)
