Did you ever have one of those moments when you decide that you&#8217;re going to change your life, and it feels like the dawn of a new era?

New Year&#8217;s Eve is one of those moments. You take a chance, turn over a new leaf and dump bad habits. You officially decide that you&#8217;ll quit smoking for good, and usually you fail within the next 15 days. There&#8217;s a sense of disappointment about breaking the oath, and you most likely don&#8217;t renew your commitment. After all, who wants to fail again? Who wants to look like a flake?

I still have this problem, sometimes, but it was even worse when I was a Buddhist monk. At the time I had spiritual commitments, and they were really hard to keep. Take the vow not to lie, for instance. Have you ever tried not to lie AT ALL for a week? A month? If so, you probably know that it&#8217;s almost impossible—we always lie, hide, change facts. I&#8217;m no exception to that rule, so as a monk it was clear to me that I was breaking that vow everyday. I felt terrible each time, but my spiritual guides would always reassure me and tell me that **commitments are just tools to help mind progress and stay headed in the right direction**, so they are meant to be damaged.

In the long run I learned the lesson and made it a habit to renew my promises as soon as I broke them. It also gave me a totally different view of what promises are for, how they should be used, and how to keep them.

### Promises are a means to an end

A promise is nowhere near as important as the project it serves. It&#8217;s only there to help you achieve your goal: to stop smoking, to lose weight, to achieve happiness in your relationship &#8230;

&nbsp;

When you make a promise or commit to do something, **keep in mind what you want to achieve**.  Your goal is what matters, not the promise that helps its completion. Why? Because if you think that the promise is super important and then you break it, you&#8217;ll be tempted to abandon the project out of discouragement. When you pay too much attention to promises and not enough to the goal, you&#8217;re like a guy that drives staring at the wheel instead of minding the road. Where do you think that ends?

A promise is supposed to help you and others around you. If it prevents you from moving on, just trash it.

### Big promise = Big Failure

We often think that if we have a BIG project, we should make a BIG commitment to achieve it. It only makes sense in theory. In practice, it usually leads to disaster. **If you make a promise that&#8217;s hard to keep, you&#8217;re more likely to renege &#8211;** it&#8217;s that simple.  Maybe you’ll feel heroic as you claim you&#8217;ll lose 40 pounds in the next month, but in a month from now after you’ve lost merely 4, how are you going to feel? Bad, probably, and not really willing to try again.

The solution is to **chunk your big promise in small promises that you can keep**. It&#8217;s more fun this way. What&#8217;s even nicer: you&#8217;ll build up self-confidence by keeping more and more promises and feeling great about each success.

### Kick guilt out of the way

Ok, so let&#8217;s say you screwed up. You said you would be there for someone when they needed you. They called for help, you didn&#8217;t show up. After that you felt horrible, and you swore you wouldn&#8217;t do it again. That&#8217;s called regret, and it&#8217;s a useful function of your mind that helps you not to make the same mistake twice.

Now, if you dwell on regret longer than needed it&#8217;ll turn into **guilt: a cool way to hurt yourself and not get anywhere**. Guilt is neurotic, useless and sticky. It&#8217;s a waste of time, especially if you want to help others. Make sure you kick it out of you mind asap. Here&#8217;s what you can do instead: move on! Don&#8217;t rehearse in your head how you failed miserably, just move on.

I know that this is easier said than done for those with a Judeo-Christian background, like me. We&#8217;ve been trained to consider guilt as virtuous, so every time we break a promise we make it our duty to feel like crap. Let&#8217;s face it, though—that inherited guilt thing is nonsense.

Just pardon yourself and move on already! The world needs you as a fully functional and happy person, not a buggy little robot spinning endlessly around the same regrets.

Once again: promises are not sacred, what&#8217;s sacred is your goal. We all break promises, and whatever we achieve in the long run is obtained through a series of mistakes and imperfections.

To wrap it up: **no matter what promise you make, if you break it, wipe the slate clean, renew your commitment, just move on and don&#8217;t quit**.

Don&#8217;t lose the momentum you gained by promising to get somewhere… feed it. Keep running in the right direction. It&#8217;s OK to fail.

And if you&#8217;re concerned by what others might think about you failing, don&#8217;t worry, they&#8217;ll forget and they&#8217;ll forgive. What everybody will remember in the end is what you achieved when you reach your destination.
