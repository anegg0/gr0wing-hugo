Are you fed up of being successful with females?

Wondering what's the ultimate secret to ruin your sex life and enter a monastery?

Here are **10 laws that will insure the most embarrassing situations in bed with a woman,** trust me, I know my business at ruining the show:

### 

###  Introduction:

### Remember: you're on your own

You might be in a cosy place enjoying a first date with a woman you like but don't be fooled by appearances: it's about performance here and she's the sole judge for that.

Focus on the certainty that you are alone carrying the entire responsibility of that encounter: everything depends on you.

Can you feel the burden?

That should already be enough to stress you out beyond recognition: failure is already looming ahead, don't worry.

### 

### Hurry up!

As you get more intimate with her: make jerky moves like you don't know what you're doing.

Don't waste an opportunity to look awkward, a good way to achieve that is to be obsessed with the intercourse and neglect anything else: the purpose is to make her  feel predated and insecure.

&nbsp;

### Don't let her take initiatives

Make her feel who's the boss. Let's be clear: you're the guy and you should be leading the show.

If you let her follow her inspiration in bed, that means you share your power with her . As a consequence she might  feel good about herself.

There's even a risk she starts expressing her personality, so please stay in control and you can be sure she'll gradually loose interest.

### Avoid communication

Don't tell her how you feel in the moment, this rule alone is a key to success to a sexual suicide.  
Make sure you don't give her any clue about what's going on in your mind: **she must become gradually confused and paranoid.** Ideally you want her to think that she's ugly and you're too decent to tell her.

&nbsp;

### Stick to the standards: don't be creative!

In bed, avoid any position that could be funny and playful, she might like it and even worse: that would relax both of you. You certainly don't want that to happen.  
Instead, seek inspiration in porn movies:

### Porn, Porn, Porn!

Behave like a porn actor: she'll love that!

Skip foreplay and anything that takes time and attention, focus on the CORE part, that's what matters.

Especially squeeze and shake her boobs like a 3 year old getting hysterical with their first GI joe action figure. Needless to say that **brutality is a winner on the path of sexual failure.**

Another important point: raise the expectations you have on yourself, raise them way beyond what any normal human being can deliver.

Here's a sure way to do that:

### Focus on "size is everything"

"Size is everything", repeat that like a mantra and alternate this chanting with visualizations of porn titans like Rocco Siffredi for instance.

Now look at yourself in the mirror: don't you feel like a joke?

Excellent.

Your self esteem should have hit rock bottom by now,  it's the perfect time to focus on what a disappointment you must be for your partner.

Avoid thinking that there's a biological reason for most men to have a regular sized penis, if common sense gets on the way you might regain respect for yourself.

In fact, most women would gladly trade any porn boner for genuine attention and good sex. But avoid consider that fact, even if that's true.

"ENLARGE YOUR PENIS", that's the idea that should logically trigger an erection problem.

### It didn't work? It's all your fault

If you've applied the above, chances are you couldn't get it up.

GREAT JOB!

Now she feels bad for you and she's probably  trying to make you feel ok about it.

**Don't let her kindness save the situation!**

Somebody has to be guilty and that person is **YOU**. It can't be just a bad alignment or a lack of chemistry.

By taking full responsibility for what happened, you exclude her completely from the relationship and with a bit of luck she'll be in distress.

We're getting close to a total disaster now, you almost made it but be careful:

you're still at risk to experience women's forgiveness.

To prevent that, keep the following in mind:

### Once you've failed, it's forever

At this stage it's important to make sure that there's no coming back.

There's a general rule in life: it says that in order to succeed you first have to fail, fail and fail.

You would seriously improve your love making if you try that approach, so stay away from it and don't let positive attitudes take over.

What's really important here is to concentrate on your failure and make it as big as possible.  
**Convince yourself that she'll never forgive you.**

If you're out of luck, she'll be understanding (a lot of women are like that),  in that case, you're only option is to reject her.

I know it's difficult, but believe me: being alone and miserable comes at a cost, you have to be strong.

### Don't give a second chance
