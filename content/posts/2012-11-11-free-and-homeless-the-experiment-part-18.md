  Another week in NYC.<br /> I&#8217;m feeling horrible these days, my black dog is here with me.

Trying to improve your mood makes sense, up to a certain point, but when you reach rock bottom, surrendering and giving yourself a break is probably the best approach.

### Mood bankruptcy

So here I go, after quite some weeks trying to cope with a growing fit of depression. I&#8217;ve decided to file mood bankruptcy. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to win this battle, I ran out of solutions and trying to talk myself into happiness will only make me look like a tragic clown. No self-help method seems to do the trick anymore. The effort needed to resist my state exceeded what I can give.

I decided to drop out and let it go.

I always remember what my friend Guillaume Jégou once told me:  
"when I really feel like hell, I surrender and I let myself drown. Then I rest there, at the bottom".

 His words stayed with me for a long time. And I decided to apply this policy when I went through a strong wave of depression.

This piece of advice goes against most self-help literature I&#8217;ve seen, maybe that&#8217;s why I like it so much: it has a punk flavor to it :)

You just drop out, you accept your fate and let the black wave of discomfort invade your mind…To finally discover that it was just a passing dream.

### War is over

"Fighting depression" is a misleading expression. I stopped using that martial terminology a while ago because it only leads to more confusion. If you assume that you have to struggle against depression, you believe that you&#8217;re dealing with a serious threat.

But there&#8217;s nothing real here, only a temporary feeling, the sooner you lay your weapons on the ground, the faster the recovery.

The best way I found out of depression is:

1/ acknowledgement > I admit that I&#8217;m depressed  
2/ acceptance > I accept that state and I treat myself as a friend

3/ pleasure > I give way for creative solutions that will help me feel better.  
In short, my whole approach is completely the opposite of waging war against an inner enemy. As I said <a title="Anger, my buddy" href="http://www.gr0wing.com/anger-my-buddy/" target="_blank">here</a>, fighting an emotion often makes it bigger.  
There&#8217;s a lot of relief in switching strategy, from combat mode, to acceptance and creativity.

### Naughty boy

Another efficient approach I use is to INDULGE. I pick the stupidest things that I like and I spend time:  
&#8211; eating Chocolate  
&#8211; having Sex with my GF  
&#8211; watching Zombie movies  
&#8211; smoking Weed  
&#8211; Oversleeping

That&#8217;s where creativity helps me the most: finding all the best ways to indulge and be counterproductive.

All that, combined with a lot of exercise and meditation, seems to be the right cocktail to dissolve a horrible mood.

And that&#8217;s what I did. And once again it did the job.  
I&#8217;m still in NYC. Still kind of broke.  
But my mind stopped soaking in dirty juice: the black dog is retreating to the dark land where it belongs.
