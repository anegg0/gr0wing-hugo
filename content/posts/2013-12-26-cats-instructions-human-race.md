My cat is a bastard. Actually he&#8217;s not my cat, he&#8217;s my stepdaughter&#8217;s cat. And he&#8217;s not really a bastard either, just a selfish little guy that doesn&#8217;t compromise with people&#8217;s expectations.

My cat is fun to watch, and a bit creepy at times. You&#8217;ve already seen how cats behave, I&#8217;m sure you know what I&#8217;m trying to say.

You probably also noticed how they send messages&#8230;silently, without uttering a word. They&#8217;re the best teachers because they could care less about giving you a lesson. 

All they do is nap by the window, or turn their royal butt at a visitor who thought they were a pet. I love how their behavior challenges my own insecurities&#8230;And my understanding.

Watching my cat made me want to soak in feline qualities, and if I were to sum up his silent advice, here&#8217;s how I&#8217;d phrase it:

  1. **Don&#8217;t bother proving anything**  
    Don&#8217;t be so desperate for approval, that&#8217;s what dogs do. Your life is worthy on its own without anybody witnessing it.
  2. **Don&#8217;t fight obstacles, find opportunities  
** If something gets on your way, be patient, hold on, wait until a window opens for you. In the meantime enjoy something else (lick your fur clean or take a nap). Remain on the outlook for your next chance, it&#8217;s just a moment away.
  3. **Ask for what you need, clearly**  
    Don&#8217;t beat around the bush, there&#8217;s no reason to be shy about your needs. You&#8217;re hungry? Say it! Don&#8217;t let your surrounding turn a deaf hear to your request (or they&#8217;re no friends).
  4. **Take it easy&#8230;**  
    Keep the hissing for the very extreme cases. You can be relaxed most of the time.  
    You think you&#8217;re too stressed to be cool? Stretch a bit. Do it again. Now try to yawn some. There you go :)
  5. **Learn how to cut short**  
    Once again, There&#8217;s really no point in losing an eye over an argument, just bite or scratch once to get your point across, then leave.
  6. **Show love  
** Look at those that you love, don&#8217;t forget to show that you appreciate and value their company. You don&#8217;t need to be loud, showing love can be as simple as letting them pet you.
  7. **Nap like there&#8217;s no tomorrow  
** Sleep** **as soon as you feel sleepy, don&#8217;t postpone it, better take a 20 minutes nap now that you really need it. This tip makes you far more efficient than it seems.
  8. **Find a cool spot**  
    If you don&#8217;t feel right working in the office, do it in the living room or even <a href="http://www.gr0wing.com/howto-work-from-your-bed/" title="How to work from your bed" target="_blank">in your bed</a>, don&#8217;t underestimate a quiet moment in the sunset light, that might be the best way to be productive AND relaxed.
  9. **Don&#8217;t pretend you like them**  
    Seriously, if you dislike someone, don&#8217;t pretend you do. What&#8217;s in it for them in the long run, anyway, rejection? Unless you intend to make it a spiritual practice, don&#8217;t mingle with those who give you the creeps.
 10. **Play**  
    Play more often, especially because it&#8217;s stupid and meaningless. As long as it doesn&#8217;t hurt anyone, play, whatever that means to you.

> “What&#8217;s your name,&#8217; Coraline asked the cat. &#8216;Look, I&#8217;m Coraline. Okay?&#8217;  
> &#8216;Cats don&#8217;t have names,&#8217; it said.  
> &#8216;No?&#8217; said Coraline.  
> &#8216;No,&#8217; said the cat. &#8216;Now you people have names. That&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t know who you are. We know who we are, so we don&#8217;t need names.”
