My cat is a bastard. Actually he's not my cat, he's my stepdaughter's cat. And he's not really a bastard either, just a selfish little guy that doesn't compromise with people's expectations.

My cat is fun to watch, and a bit creepy at times. You've already seen how cats behave, I'm sure you know what I'm trying to say.

You probably also noticed how they send messages&#8230;silently, without uttering a word. They're the best teachers because they could care less about giving you a lesson. 

All they do is nap by the window, or turn their royal butt at a visitor who thought they were a pet. I love how their behavior challenges my own insecurities&#8230;And my understanding.

Watching my cat made me want to soak in feline qualities, and if I were to sum up his silent advice, here's how I'd phrase it:

  1. **Don't bother proving anything**  
    Don't be so desperate for approval, that's what dogs do. Your life is worthy on its own without anybody witnessing it.
  2. **Don't fight obstacles, find opportunities  
** If something gets on your way, be patient, hold on, wait until a window opens for you. In the meantime enjoy something else (lick your fur clean or take a nap). Remain on the outlook for your next chance, it's just a moment away.
  3. **Ask for what you need, clearly**  
    Don't beat around the bush, there's no reason to be shy about your needs. You're hungry? Say it! Don't let your surrounding turn a deaf hear to your request (or they're no friends).
  4. **Take it easy&#8230;**  
    Keep the hissing for the very extreme cases. You can be relaxed most of the time.  
    You think you're too stressed to be cool? Stretch a bit. Do it again. Now try to yawn some. There you go :)
  5. **Learn how to cut short**  
    Once again, There's really no point in losing an eye over an argument, just bite or scratch once to get your point across, then leave.
  6. **Show love  
** Look at those that you love, don't forget to show that you appreciate and value their company. You don't need to be loud, showing love can be as simple as letting them pet you.
  7. **Nap like there's no tomorrow  
** Sleep** **as soon as you feel sleepy, don't postpone it, better take a 20 minutes nap now that you really need it. This tip makes you far more efficient than it seems.
  8. **Find a cool spot**  
    If you don't feel right working in the office, do it in the living room or even <a href="http://www.gr0wing.com/howto-work-from-your-bed/" title="How to work from your bed" target="_blank">in your bed</a>, don't underestimate a quiet moment in the sunset light, that might be the best way to be productive AND relaxed.
  9. **Don't pretend you like them**  
    Seriously, if you dislike someone, don't pretend you do. What's in it for them in the long run, anyway, rejection? Unless you intend to make it a spiritual practice, don't mingle with those who give you the creeps.
 10. **Play**  
    Play more often, especially because it's stupid and meaningless. As long as it doesn't hurt anyone, play, whatever that means to you.

> &#8216;Cats don't have names,' it said.  
> &#8216;No?' said Coraline.  
> &#8216;No,' said the cat. &#8216;Now you people have names. That's because you don't know who you are. We know who we are, so we don't need names.”
