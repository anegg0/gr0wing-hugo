  Hi everyone!
</p>

That&#8217;s it, <a href="http://www.gr0wing.com/about-this-blog/" target="_blank">&#8220;Growing The Roots Of Happiness&#8221;</a> is now a one-year-old-baby.

I&#8217;d like to thank all of you for regularly stopping by and leaving comments.

Writing a blog made me spend lots of time on the web, much more than a reasonable user. Since I dug in a lot of content, I&#8217;d like to share with you the best of what I saw: <!--more-->

### Growing:

<p style="text-align: left;">
  My last week&#8217;s discovery is David Cain&#8217;s <a href="http://www.raptitude.com/" target="_blank">Raptitude</a>, beautifully written posts his inner life and how to grow as a human being.
</p>

### Contemplating:

<p style="text-align: left;">
  GIFs images are often barely funny, unlike Marinus&#8217; beautiful and hypnotic animated pictures: <a href="http://headlikeanorange.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">http://headlikeanorange.tumblr.com/</a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Not a movie, not a music record or a book, yet &#8220;The Art Of Pho&#8221; is a bit all of that, and it&#8217;s really sweet: <a href="http://artofpho.submarinechannel.com/" target="_blank">http://artofpho.submarinechannel.com/</a>
</p>

### Redditing:

Did you know about reddit?

Think of it as an open Facebook where everyone shares info on specific topics. It&#8217;s still a free area and censorship is nearly absent there.

Try to benefit from this portal before it turns spammy by checking the Subreddit lists (Subreddit=list of links by topic):

The (almost) complete list of Subreddits: <a href="http://subreddits.org/search.html" target="_blank">http://subreddits.org/search.html</a>

To help you find your way in Reddit, most of the below are Subreddit links:

### Learning:

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Charts don&#8217;t necessarily tell the truth, but they sometimes reveal the talent of their creators, you might want to visit the Subreddit dedicated to them: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful</a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  There&#8217;s a new blog about science, it took on the challenge of answering scientific questions in a very simple way, it busts myths like:<strong> &#8221; do we use only 10% of our brain?&#8221;</strong>. The articles are clear, interesting and you definitely feel less dumb when you&#8217;ve spent a little time on: <a href="http://whotaughtyouscience.com/" target="_blank">http://whotaughtyouscience.com/</a>

### Minimalism:

Here are two links as a follow up for my post on [urban monks][1] :

### Personal development

There&#8217;s an abundance of self improvement material on Reddit, here&#8217;s a few related Subreddits:

  * **Zen Habits**: personal development with a touch of meditation <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ZenHabits" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/ZenHabits</a>
  * **Self Improvement**: traditional content at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement</a>
  * **Self Help**: more personal improvement posts <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/</a>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Last but not least, if you&#8217;re tired of Facebook, try the totally alternative social <a href="https://joindiaspora.com/users/sign_up" target="_blank">*DIASPORA</a>, not many people there, but a few enthusiastic users (friend me there :)
