> &#8220;When the world is filled with dissatisfaction, transform adverse conditions into the path of enlightenment&#8221; &#8211; Lojong slogan

  * Is it an argument with my wife or a chance to clear the air with her and start afresh?
  * Is it lack of money or an opportunity to simplify my life?
  * Was he a disappointing friend or someone who showed me <a href="http://www.gr0wing.com/how-to-get-rid-of-toxic-people/" title="How to deal with toxic people" target="_blank">who I shouldn&#8217;t waste time with?</a>

And what about this horrible job that I quit, did I just make a serious mistake or did I start designing a better lifestyle?

The answers to these questions are equally true, depending on how you want to look at things, a curse or a blessing, it&#8217;s up to you to decide.

</div>We might feel that our lives are flooded with problems, yet every single single situation is potential fuel for growth.

Since our ability to leverage the chaos is only a matter of training, for a moment, imagine the lightspeed progress you&#8217;d make if troubles actually made you more alive, smarter, more compassionate?

Given the kind of crap we get everyday, it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re at risk to run out of opportunities&#8230;

PS: Regarding the Buddhist practice of changing adverse life circumstances, I recommend:[Start Where You Are: A Guide to Compassionate Living &#8211; Pema Chodron][1]<img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=grotherooofha-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=1570628394" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
