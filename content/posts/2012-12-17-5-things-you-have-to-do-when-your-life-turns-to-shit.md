### A survival kit

Ok, there you are, you managed to hit rock bottom, a state of ultimate broke and despair, a face to face with bankruptcy and depression.

Since problems usually come in bundled offers, destiny has treated you with a few more disappointments: your girlfriend now thinks you should be &#8220;good friends&#8221; while your actual buddies lost all their fingers and can&#8217;t pick up your calls.

You&#8217;re on your own.

Before considering options like suicide by gas or meth overdose, try these tips, they&#8217;re great when everything is falling apart.

### Work out

Run, swim, do yoga and BREATHE BIG. Do whatever it takes to flood your system with fresh blood and oxygen.

There are good reasons why working out squashes depression.

<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=work+out+depression&oq=work+out+depression&sugexp=chrome,mod=6&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#hl=en&safe=off&tbo=d&sclient=psy-ab&q=work+out+helps+depression&oq=work+out+helps+depression&gs_l=serp.3...28674.31250.0.31468.10.8.2.0.0.3.253.1614.0j6j2.8.0.les%3Bcrnk_timediscountb..0.0...1c.1.PU3di_oPKac&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.1355325884,d.d2k&fp=f17cf40a2bd9a545&bpcl=39967673&biw=1361&bih=738" target="_blank">Google it </a>if you&#8217;re not convinced.

On top of that: you don&#8217;t need to think to work out, that&#8217;s great when you feel you have Mayo instead of a brain.

### Look up!

Don&#8217;t look down, that&#8217;s what everybody does when depressed.  
Look up.

Also: pump up your chest. Smile if you can. Remember your posture the last time you were feeling great (right before you checked your latest bank statement).

That&#8217;s no bs: position your body as if you were feeling good, your mind will follow (they&#8217;re connected, that&#8217;s why).

### Watch South Park

Or whatever dumbest comedy works for you. Everything has been made fun of, that includes the kind of crap you&#8217;re going through.

Talking yourself out of bad feelings doesn&#8217;t work as well as laughing them out.

Here&#8217;s a good piece about being broke for instance:  


&nbsp;

### Remember: that&#8217;s not forever

I don&#8217;t care if it sounds lame to say it, so I&#8217;ll say it again:

&#8220;This too shall pass&#8221;.

Think about  all the disasters you experienced where you thought pain would crush you entirely&#8230;

What&#8217;s left of all that?

Nothing.

The same will hold true for this present situation.

### Ride the blessing

Don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re cursed, you&#8217;re not.

Hard times operate like purifiers: they shower away life&#8217;s cling-ons: unreliable people, crappy girlfriends (or boyfriends), jobs that you hated anyway.

They also cleanse your life of stale beliefs and help you gain actual knowledge on yourself.

Once the storm is gone, you&#8217;ll start a new life: you&#8217;ll be wiser and stronger, and you&#8217;ll know for sure who you can really count on.

Ride the blessing, you&#8217;re not on your own.

And if it&#8217;s an encouragement you need, you surely have mine :)
