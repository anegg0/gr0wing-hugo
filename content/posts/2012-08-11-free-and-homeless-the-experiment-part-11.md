  Peace of mind is easy to find at the airport&#8217;s gate.<br /> No one knows you there.
</p>

I&#8217;m leaving Latin America.

### Bliss in between

I&#8217;ve entered the Airport in San Salvador, going to the US.

It&#8217;s located nowhere. It doesn&#8217;t look and feel like El Salvador.

  <p id="caption-attachment-3510" class="wp-caption-text">
    Pupusas, Salvadorans are obsessed with pupusas.
  </p>
</div>

Here, no pupusas anymore, Subway sandwiches instead.<!--more-->

The country&#8217;s heat has also been replaced by the AC.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Cool artisanal ads don&#8217;t cover the walls with their screaming colors, they&#8217;re not clean enough for an airport, I guess.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3511" title="digicell" src="http://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/digicell.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="282" srcset="https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/digicell.jpg 600w, https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/digicell-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/digicell-588x276.jpg 588w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> 

Only boring posters with corporate handshakes, smiling happy faces or luxury products.

&nbsp;

I&#8217;m now in the airport&#8217;s international zone, the bleached, secure area where nothing happens.

I know that I can completely relax in the predictability of the place. The lame relaxing music, the 6 Dollars coffee, the carefully selected news on-screen&#8230;  
I might be bored to tears but at least no bad surprise can happen here.

I like that.

And nobody knows me. Nobody gives a damn who I am.

I&#8217;m nobody here.

As the plane finally takes off, there&#8217;s that feeling of being pulled up so hard my guts are staying on the ground.

I like that too.

My neighbor on the left is a real nice guy. We keep talking as he orders wine constantly. The entire flight. We talk some more. He doesn&#8217;t seem to be affected by alcohol, I&#8217;m wondering how many gallons of Pinot he can stomach before puking everywhere.

### Bastards

I have to connect in Atlanta. There, I meet the &#8220;Homeland security&#8221; officers (you have to talk to these guys if you want to be accepted on the US territory).  
I&#8217;m not welcome this time, I can tell. The officer in front of me  asks a loads of dumbass questions.  
When I&#8217;m done answering, he asks them again. Then I&#8217;m sent to an interview with another officer.

Things will turn out good for my case, but I get to see how they treat others.

That&#8217;s not pretty. A latino is interrogated in front of me. The guy doesn&#8217;t speak english so they call a translator.

The officer tells the latino that he doesn&#8217;t buy what he says. He raises his voice.  
The latino guy tries to smile, in an impressive effort to be nice.  
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like your smile, you making fun of me?&#8221;  
The translator converts all the bullying back to spanish, along with the angry tone and all. It&#8217;s pretty interesting: these people are paid to intimidate others.

&#8220;Go sit, I&#8217;ll take your hat, I don&#8217; t want to see you with a hat, now&#8221;.  
The officer takes the guy&#8217;s hat. Puts it on a table behind him. Confiscated.  
The latino goes back and sits quietly. God knows what&#8217;s next. They&#8217;ll probably send him back to his country.

I leave the office with my passport, I didn&#8217;t say anything to stop what I just saw.

I postponed my avenger&#8217;s life once more.

&nbsp;

Night has fallen, my plane to NYC is about to land. I don&#8217;t really think. I&#8217;m  happy to see Vilma again.

OK, I know, I&#8217;m not the super hero you expected, but give me a chance to be the one that will eventually save the world:
