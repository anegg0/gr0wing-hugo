<span style="font-size: 16px;">Sales people are obnoxious.</span>

&nbsp;

They pretend to be your friend, but all they&#8217;re trying to do is make you sign a 12 months payment plan for a barbecue set.

<p style="text-align: center;">

You know it, a sales person&#8217;s friendship is no friendship, it smells weird the moment they enter the room.

Everything down to their body language is a disposable sales pitch.

They would do and say whatever you want to hear: the only thing at stake is the goddamn barbecue set they&#8217;re trying to make you sign for.

&nbsp;

I guess I&#8217;m only saying this because as I grow older, I value more the art of saying and doing nice things **for free**, with less expectations.

&nbsp;

Take complimenting someone, for instance: an honest, **FREE** compliment.

&nbsp;

Few bother complimenting and encouraging others, yet if you start making it a daily practice, all kinds of people start becoming your friends (some are even willing to help you, sometimes).

&nbsp;

I didn&#8217;t say it was easy to do, making compliment is touchy, but I think <span style="font-size: 16px;">every single human is hungry for acknowledgment and praise, even if they pretend not to care.</span>

Few people bother giving that kind of attention, though, I&#8217;m not sure why.

Maybe they&#8217;re just held off by anxiety (I know I am, very often)?

&nbsp;

Maybe, like me, one of their main fear is BEING REJECTED?

After all, what if the person you compliment is a <span style="font-size: 18px;">girl full of herself that gets invited everyday by guys 30 times richer and more handsome than you?</span>

&nbsp;

What if people believe that you&#8217;re just about to <span style="font-size: 18px;">ask them for money?</span>

Or that you&#8217;re just a **maniac that has a shrine where he hangs pictures of girls next to bottles of old people&#8217;s saliva?**

&nbsp;

It&#8217;s legitimate to fear the worst rejection scenarios when you decide to open up and say something nice, but in reality, there&#8217;s nothing much to lose: <span style="font-size: 18px;">most people love it when someone cares enough to notice their qualities and mention them.</span>

And those who might reject you are so self-centered that they&#8217;ll forget whatever you told them 5 mn after you said it.

&nbsp;

I have nothing to sell through this article, just let me share what I&#8217;ve been trying to do for a few years:

<span style="font-size: 16px;">I&#8217;ve been trying to compliment people more often, whether young or old, good-looking or not, smart or dumb, whoever they are, I always find something real to say.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">Nobody&#8217;s crappy enough to only have shortcomings, right?<br /> </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 18px;">Now I&#8217;m sure that this strategy works: as long as you&#8217;re not trying to sell anything, people are happy when you identify their qualities, like the way they sing or the shape of their signature.</span>

&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Or even the raincoat they chose for their ugly dog.

The world is a tough place. If you open the fire first by mentioning people&#8217;s bright side, you&#8217;ll get a rewarding feedback, <span style="font-size: 16px;">simply because a sincere compliment can go a long way in someone&#8217;s mind, it can even change a destiny, sometimes.</span>

And it costs nothing. Just a tiny bit of care and attention.
