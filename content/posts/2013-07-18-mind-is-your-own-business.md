_I wanted to change the world. But I have found that the only thing one can be sure of changing is oneself._ — Aldous Huxley

&nbsp;

Every call I give to a 1-800 number reminds me of Georges Orwell's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four" target="_blank">1984</a>. As I dial my way through the non-sensical menu, I grind my teeth in anger but the digital voice doesn't care. It fakes courtesy but keeps blocking the way to a real person,  it knows that I will comply. And I will, for lack of a better option.

I'll answer the goddamn questions.

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">"please enter your customer reference number"</span>

"I'm sorry, I didn't understand your answer, please choose from the following options&#8230;"

"All our customer service representatives are busy at this time, please renew your call later, thank you."

With optimized processes like online assistance , free will<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"> can easily be stolen from individuals. G</span></span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">overnment and industries know it, and they use our vulnerability at their convenience.</span>

If you want human beings to obey, just isolate them from each other and set up a help desk. They'll comply.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Yet

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">We're still human beings, though. We care for each other </span>

  * **Western governments** should support democracy and education in the countries that need it, instead they start wars in the Middle-East just to get oil for free
  * **School systems** should have made us creative individuals fit to survive in a globalized market. Instead, they brainwashed us into corporate obedience. And we all get laid-off.
  * **Airline companies** should take care of their passengers, instead they charge $30 for excess baggage weight and serve you half-sized coke cans onboard.

They're wrong. Completely and lamentably wrong.

&nbsp;

Getting angry would seem like a sensible thing to do.  Generations of unhappy citizens have followed that simple procedure in the past:

  1. <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">getting angry</span>
  2. taking to the streets
  3. hopefully get things to change

&nbsp;

For now, these control tools have been successful at channeling millions of people's anger though the process. So that companies can succesfully cash in
