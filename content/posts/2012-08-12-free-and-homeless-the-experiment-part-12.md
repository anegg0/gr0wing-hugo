<p style="background-color: silver;">
  I practice Buddhist meditation.<br /> I&#8217;ve done that in the past 15 years.<br /> When you travel a lot, that&#8217;s a good habit to have.
</p>

&nbsp;

I don&#8217;t want to go crazy.

So I meditate.

That&#8217;s the best way to keep my mind on the right track.

Meditation is simple, and it&#8217;s dirt cheap.<!--more-->

  
You don&#8217;t need a lot of expensive devices to do it.  
All you need is your mind.

I do have a mind, the poor thing is bombarded by Ads and information and shit.

&nbsp;

Meditation cuts through all that junk, it gives me a safe ground to start with, everyday. And it combines well with a homeless lifestyle.

### 5% needs

If you travel,  meditations makes you happy with less. A pillow to sit on, a watch to monitor your session, that&#8217;s it.

Entertainment becomes less important.

Isn&#8217;t it nice to know that you won&#8217;t get bored, even when there&#8217;s nothing much around you?

You just get your butt on the pillow, and meditate.

Then, with a lighter mind, you can visit the world.  With less expectations, and more curiosity.

That&#8217;s also a nice tool to fix your heart if it&#8217;s been damaged by someone, or  by your own inner civil war.

&nbsp;

They even say that if you practice it a lot you realize the essence of your own mind. I&#8217;m far from that level of accomplishment personally, but I feel the investment in time has been well beyond my wildest expectations.

If you haven&#8217;t tried, I think you should. it&#8217;s probably one of the best favors you can do to yourself.

That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll tell you about meditation today, I&#8217;m not going to advertise some more.

I&#8217;m not going to tell you how to do it, either. None the less,  if you&#8217;re interested in learning about it, you might want to try <a href="http://www.dhagpo-kagyu-ling.org/en/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://dharmakaya.org/" target="_blank">here</a>, or <a href="http://www.diamondway-buddhism.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.  
There are other places, of course, but beware of <a href="http://www.scientology.org/" target="_blank">spiritual scams</a>.

&nbsp;

BTW: I&#8217;ve arrived in the US since a while, will tell you more about it very soon.
