"I&#8217;m shit",  I&#8217;d repeat to myself, like a mantra.

That was in 2008.

I had dived into Buddhism head first, had become a Monk, meditated for thousands of hours, performed countless prostrations and visualizations. A decade through all that practice I was feeling worse than ever, had insane nightmares, anxiety attacks and a well rooted depression.

"I didn&#8217;t get anywhere spiritually, I just screwed my life up" that&#8217;s all my poor old brain would come up with.

I don&#8217;t like to throw the towel usually, but when I realized that I was keeping my religious vows only to avoid public embarrassment, I knew it was time to take a break from the spiritual life.

I guess it worked: I&#8217;m way happier now..<!--more-->

Leaving was tough, like a break up, a battle between desire and guilt, but I don&#8217;t regret this decision. It made me to grow and it made my spiritual practice grow too.

There&#8217;s a  whole bunch of other people who decide to quit their religious groups and return to a regular life, some come back, some don&#8217;t: there&#8217;s no ideal solution but I&#8217;m pretty sure of one thing:  
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">secluding yourself in a spiritual community doesn&#8217;t work in the long run.</span>

If you&#8217;ve been deeply involved in a cult with which you&#8217;re no longer thriving but you&#8217;re too afraid to leave, that post might help.

&nbsp;

### How do you know you&#8217;re in trouble?

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Discovering a spirituality often feels like a honey moon. That blessed state lasts for a while, then it wears off. Casual practitioners will simply step out and find something else to get excited about.</span>

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">It&#8217;s much harder for </span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">those who </span></span>committed<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"> deeply, those for whom spirituality means more than a disposable trend, Monks are a good example of that</span></span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">.</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">When their human desires come in conflicts with the values accepted by their community, they&#8217;re faced with a choice: staying or leaving. </span>

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">That kind of </span>dilemma<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"> often causes tremendous anxiety, </span></span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> guilt and shame. Now i</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">f on top of that, none of their spiritual brothers want to hear about it, that&#8217;s a red flag.</span>

That simply means your spiritual environment can no longer offer a healthy response to your need. That means you should get out, to put it bluntly.

Let me list up a few common symptoms that you need to consider seriously:

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li>
    <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><strong>Guilt</strong> &#8211; You feel guilty for any reason: for </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">not doing all your master said, for</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> being a spiritual fraud,  for </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">indulging in "worldly pleasures" for </span>wishing to leave the community
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><strong>Worthlessness</strong> &#8211; your self-esteem has hit rock bottom </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><strong>Shame</strong> &#8211; You&#8217;re ashamed of what you are, mostly</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><strong>Depression</strong> &#8211; You don&#8217;t find  joy in anything, not even in your practice and prayers</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Loneliness</strong><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"> &#8211; You feel extremely isolated and you’ve given up on telling others because&#8230;you know you&#8217;d be ostracized or punished in some way</span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"><br /> </span></span>
  </li>
</ul>

Feeling like that is NOT part of a healthy spiritual path, and if you can&#8217;t find help where you are, you might want to switch strategy.

### What to do?

### How about spending time with the heretics&#8230;

Don&#8217;t even try to figure how you got yourself in that dead-end.

Don&#8217;t try to find who&#8217;s responsible, whether it&#8217;s yourself or the religion you&#8217;re involved in. You should just reach OUT.

How long has it been since you spent time with your family?

With your friends?

With regular people?  
Ask yourself this simple question, it&#8217;ll speak volumes regarding your level of mental confinement.

There&#8217;s a whole bunch of people who can help you simply because they don&#8217;t belong to your religious movement, they don&#8217;t share the same fears and expectations and that&#8217;s what you need when you&#8217;re intoxicated with a dogma. You need air, something else for your mind.

Just get on the phone and go out with people who have nothing to do with your spirituality, people whom you trust and who don&#8217;t think like bigots. Are you afraid to do that? Do you believe that mingling with atheists might ruin your faith?

Have you considered that it might actually strengthen your bond with the core of your practice? (t did for me :)

Whether they&#8217;re friends of family, being around “non-spiritual” people gives you a more balanced and healthy perspective, it opens your mind. It doesn’t mean that you should switch your current beliefs to theirs; it just puts things in a different perspective.

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">If you&#8217;re just temporarily depressed, they&#8217;ll cheer you up. You will reassert your spiritual commitments and gladly get back to it, so that&#8217;s great.</span>

If you were actually manipulated by a bad <a title="How to choose a spiritual master" href="http://www.gr0wing.com/how-to-choose-a-spiritual-master/" target="_blank">spiritual master</a>, you&#8217;ll get a chance to get out of the trap, that&#8217;s great as well.

And after that?

It&#8217;s up to you, but for your information<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">, I didn&#8217;t stop practicing either. In fact, I feel more inclined to practicing than ever.</span>
