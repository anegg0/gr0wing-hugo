I got fired from a tele-marketing gig. It was a horrible job.

I had applied for the position because I needed the money real bad. They fired me two weeks later:  I hadn&#8217;t sold anything.

And they didn&#8217;t like my attitude.

So there I was: laid off of one of the simplest, unqualified jobs available on the marketplace…

    That&#8217;s me trying to tele-market
  </p>
</div>

What was I going to tell my friends?

More importantly, what was I going to tell myself?  
Talking about a self-esteem issue&#8230;

It was time to draw conclusions from this failure,  and I had to do it before my mind settled for a negative belief (&#8220;I&#8217;m crap&#8221; being one of them).

There was an unlimited supply of justifications available to me, things like:

**A- I got laid-off because I&#8217;m a loser**, I&#8217;m not even capable of holding a brain-dead position for two damned weeks

**B- I got fired because this company&#8217;s management is horrendous**, they should settle in a nasty-ass slave-factory like Qatar or Dubai(they probably will)

**C- I got fired because Reptilians used micro-waves to control my brain**, which totally messed up my sales performances

**D- I got fired because I&#8217;m simply not fit for that job**, and it doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t perform in much better positions than this one

Out of the four options, option D sounded best: I was not fit for that job. Or even better: that job didn&#8217;t fit me.

I felt it would help me feel better about myself, it would also be a good foundation to approach other jobs more confidently.

Was option D truer than the others?

I didn&#8217;t know, neither did I care. I simply chose it because it was helpful, when all the others were useless or disempowering.

I&#8217;ll even dare to make a generalization, whenever you&#8217;re faced with a challenge, ask yourself:

### What belief truly supports you?

&nbsp;

What mindset would you need to adopt to get out of pain and respond positively to a situation?

Or, as Tony Robbins often says:

&#8220;**What would you have to believe to make something work?**&#8221;

And what belief  can help you support people around you? Of course, you can try to hold on to painful certainties that seem true to you, but please remember that:

1 &#8211; You don&#8217;t have to do this, you&#8217;re free to chose what meaning to attach to a situation  
2 &#8211; Your entire set of values is a pile of arbitrary labels stacked on top of each other. They&#8217;re only relatively true.

So, what&#8217;s more important? Being right or being happy?

If your priorities are well set, you&#8217;ll pick the belief that fits you just right.
