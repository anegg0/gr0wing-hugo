### Reconciling the worst of yourself

[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1121" title="paradise lost" alt="" src="http://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/paradise-lost-240x300.jpg" width="240" height="300" srcset="https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/paradise-lost-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/paradise-lost.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" />][1]This section of my blog is for the pessimistics, the nihilists, the negative thinkers. If you always see the glass half empty, if you think you look like a dork when you smile and if holidays pictures on Facebook make you want to shut down your computer, you and I have something in common. I actually wrote this series of articles for us. For the others, the ones that don&#8217;t know what negative moods feel like, I don&#8217;t recommend the following posts, feel free to go [here][2], instead.

I&#8217;ve entitled this chapter &#8220;The power of darkness&#8221; since I believe we all have a dark side, it&#8217;s dark because we hide it, not because it&#8217;s evil. This dark part of our personality is powerful and rich, it should not be ignored. The following articles are tips on **how to have a healthier relationship with your dark side** and how to approach guilt, frustration, anger and many other demons with less fear and shame.
