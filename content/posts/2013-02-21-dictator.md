<span style="font-size: 20px;">Once upon a time, there was a little dictator.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 20px;">He was mean and crazy like any other dictator.</span>

&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size: 20px;">He was also very small.</span>
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 20px;">So small nobody could see him, he had to scream VERY LOUD all the time to compensate for his small stature.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 20px;">And he was a total douche.</span>

&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size: 20px;">His little country looked like this:</span>
</p>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size: 20px;">It had two inhabitants: the little dictator&#8230;and me.</span>
</p>

&nbsp;

In short: I was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the only guy who had to endure his bullshit.</span>

&nbsp;

There was no pleasing him

There was no questioning him

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

UNTIL I REALIZED THAT VOICE IN MY HEAD WAS JUST THE ECHO OF A LIFE SPENT JUDGING MYSELF.

Since then, I haven&#8217;t heard of the little Dictator.

Basically,

&nbsp;

BTW, this little Dictator had many great projects for me like:

&nbsp;

&#8211; Becoming the best in the universe

&#8211; Ruling earth by force

&#8211;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 20px;">You probably have it too, though.</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I believe this Hitler lives in everyone.

&nbsp;

which made him even angrier.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Scolding me.

Commanding me to be better, always asking for more performance.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Then I realized that: there was no need for this Dictator.

&nbsp;

I could do things on my own.

&nbsp;

I&#8217;m never enough for this inner tyran.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Telling me what to do

Telling me who I am

Defining the limits of what&#8217;s good bad
