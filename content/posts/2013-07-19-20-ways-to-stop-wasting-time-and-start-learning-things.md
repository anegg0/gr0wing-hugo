No philosophy today, just a quick list of my favorite ways to save time for learning, creating and being as happy as I can.

In random order :)

### Reduce commitments

Face it, there&#8217;s too little time to attend parties and meetings and there&#8217;s only one saturday night a week. If you commit less, you&#8217;ll save time for your meaningful others instead of getting angry for having to drag yourself at your frisbee club&#8217;s annual potluck.

### Strangle your todo list

Remove 50% of the items in your todo list and get it all done this today. If you have some time left, you can still achieve more, but what about taking a hike or read with your spare time instead? and get it all done this today!

### Don&#8217;t text: call

Texting is a vague form of communication, it forces you to constantly <a href="http://www.damnyouautocorrect.com/" target="_blank">guess and clarify</a>. Skip the arguments and call her. Takes 4 mn.

### Play audiobooks

While cooking or driving, play audio versions of a book you promised you would read, you&#8217;ll learn something, you won&#8217;t get bored and the message <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/07/can-an-audiobook-change-your-life.html" target="_blank">WILL make its way to your brain</a>. I often play conferences and speeches when I cook and clean the house, I love the way it feeds my mind while doing chores that annoy the hell out of me.

### Answer your email right away

Respond to your email with short but engaging answers, don&#8217;t let more than 48 hours pass before you reply, that way the topic of conversation will still be fresh in your mind and you won&#8217;t have to spend 10 mn recalling what you&#8217;re supposed to say.

### Stream movies

Instead of watching movies on TV, <a href="http://vodly.to" target="_blank">stream them</a>! Streaming saves you the time watching lousy ads and you can decide when and where (a laptop and a connection are enough). Enjoy that solution while it&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2012/04/is-streaming-or-watching-movies-illegal.html" target="_blank">still legal</a>.

### Read on your phone

Most smartphones support reader apps such as kindle or nook, if you&#8217;re in the subway or in the airport, you can read and learn, I do that all the time now, and I often surprise myself looking forward to a long commute :)

### Cut the small talk

While making new connections, you can reduce the time talking shit and directly learn from people by identifying what they&#8217;re really passionate about and <a href="http://www.raptitude.com/2009/04/the-secret-to-connecting-with-people/" target="_blank">listen to them</a>, most humans know a lot more than they think, and they&#8217;re usually happy to share their knowledge.

### Stick a daily 30 minutes meditation in your schedule

###<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3537" alt="Egg" src="http://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Egg-e1374270488845-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /> 

Increased awareness, efficiency, enjoyment, empathy, the results will blow your mind. If 30 mn in a row is too much, feel free to split them in sessions of 10 mn, make it easy on yourself, but do it everyday, use a <a href="http://www.simpletouchsoftware.com/products/meditator/" target="_blank">meditation timer</a> to keep track smoothly.

### Exploit the half-awake state

When you&#8217;re waking up, you&#8217;re mind is permeable to positive thinking (and to negative thinking). You can waste this window worrying about future problems, or hack your mind into happiness by asking yourself the **7 morning power questions** designed by Tony Robbins:

1.What am I happy about in my life right now?  
What about that makes me happy?  
How does that make me feel?  
2.What am I excited about in my life right now?  
What about that makes me excited?  
How does that make me feel?  
3.What am I proud about in my life right now?  
What about that makes me proud?  
How does that make me feel?  
4.What am I grateful about in my life right now?  
What about that makes me grateful?  
How does that make me feel?  
5.What am I enjoying most in my life right now?  
What about that do I enjoy?  
How does that make me feel?  
6.What am I committed to in my life right now?  
What about that makes me committed?  
How does that make me feel?  
7.Who do I love? Who loves me?  
What about that makes me loving?  
How does that make me feel?

If you cringe when trying that mental work-out for the first time, chances are your mind is used to do exactly opposite, which creates a conflicts. No wonder most of us feel horrible in the morning. Negative thinking is a habit worth busting, and these 7 questions are the best warm up I can think of to give a uplifting tone my day. I&#8217;ve been practicing it for 3 years and although my mind resisted at first, it saved me thousands of cranky mornings.

### Cook a huge pot of soup

It&#8217;s easy, fast,  your pot will last for 4 days minimum and it&#8217;ll get tastier as you reach the end.  
Definitely my favorite tip to cut down on cooking time. Try <a href="https://droolfactor.wordpress.com/2010/12/17/la-potee-french-farmhouse-soup/" target="_blank">that one</a>, for instance, I recommend it, and you don&#8217;t have to add meat if you&#8217;re a vegetarian :)

### Buy bulked items

I hate to waste time in supermarkets, so if I have the storage space I buy toilet paper by the ton: it&#8217;s always needed  and so much cheaper when purchased in large quantities. Think of all the time you&#8217;ll save by grocery shopping once a month instead of twice a week .

### Optimize your time on Facebook

I reduced it to a daily 30 mn (which is still a lot, I know) I try to log in FB twice a day, not more and when I find a quote or an interesting link I post it on <a href="http://bufferapp.com" target="_blank">Buffer</a> so that I can tweet and share without wasting time on social media.

### Increase your reading speed

You&#8217;ll understand the content just as well and there are plenty of methods to speed read.  
I use <a href="http://reading-trainer.com/" target="_blank">reading trainer for iOS</a>, it&#8217;s nicely designed.

### Take snapshots

Snap a picture of the post office&#8217;s business hours with your phone, no real point in writing that down on a piece of paper. Same thing for your receipts and business cards&#8230;

### Create systematic daily habits

**Meditating 30 mn a day should be one of them.** I have a few daily habits, they don&#8217;t look that complicated but they fill the time I could waste in loop thinking or drifting endlessly on Gawker. Here&#8217;s my current list:

  * Tony Robbins 7 questions (as seen above)
  * Meditation
  * Checking bank account
  * Finding one inspiring quote (http://zenquotes.org/ is my source :)
  * writing my diary
  * writing for my blog

### Work in your head

If you&#8217;re too tired to jump at your desk, you could simply <a href="http://www.gr0wing.com/howto-work-from-your-bed/" target="_blank">work from your bed</a>, it&#8217;s so much more relaxing to close your eyes and start writing an urgent email mentally. By the time you feel rested you can stand up and type it down.

### Archive all your email

Most email software have an&#8221;archive&#8221; option (including Gmail). Use it: select all the mail in your inbox and click the archive button<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6307" alt="Archive" src="http://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Archive.jpg" width="26" height="27" /> , then enjoy the view (inbox=0). A good way to stop skimming in the huge load of spam just to find your bank statement&#8230;

### Train your memory

Your brain can remember everything, just give it some work out so you can toss most of your notes, e-Reminders and  whatnot (I don&#8217;t know about you but most of the time I don&#8217;t check them anyway).  
I personally love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452266068/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0452266068&linkCode=as2&tag=grotherooofha-20" target="_blank">Tony Buzan&#8217;s method</a>  for using it when I need to get my memory back to shape (affiliated link right here).
