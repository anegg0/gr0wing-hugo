My name's Gael Blanchemain, I am currently a Technical writer/Software Engineer. Given I'm old (52), I have a experimented a few other things, some of which are documented here.

What you'll find here is a mix of self-improvement, ecology, tech and spirituality. I write to share my experiences, not to teach you anything. I hope you'll find something useful here.  


## About the guy who started this blog

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6887" src="http://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/portrait-dessus-300x257.jpg" alt="portrait-dessus" width="300" height="257" srcset="https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/portrait-dessus-300x257.jpg 300w, https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/portrait-dessus.jpg 541w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> My name is Gaël Blanchemain, I&#8217;ve spent the last 20 years walking unconventional paths to transform myself and try to figure who I am and what I can do to make a difference.  
For instance, I became a Buddhist monk for 10 years and I also experimented a lot with psychedelics.

I love inner exploration, self improvement, ecology, web development and I set out to change the world. I write about these passions and I learn every day from all the people that connect with me.

## More about Gaël Blanchemain

<img class="alignleft wp-image-7147" src="http://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Vilma-I-400.jpg" alt="Vilma-I-400" width="240" height="320" srcset="https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Vilma-I-400.jpg 400w, https://www.gr0wing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Vilma-I-400-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /> I&#8217;m a French-man who lives in the US. I&#8217;m also a self-improvement junkie and I love to inspire and get inspired by others.

Since I was twenty (I&#8217;m 42 now), I&#8217;ve invested most of my time digging in self-help methods and spiritual traditions.

I was driven by the belief that, even though a human&#8217;s life can be extremely hard, our resources are enough to eradicate problems and limitations. Included global ones.

And I&#8217;ve encountered problems and limitations: a dysfunctional family, several fits of depression and the self-esteem of a washed-up wrestler.

Doing drugs was one of my first responses to face the pressure and absurdity of a life without spirituality. Although chemicals did provide some insights, they mainly pointed the way toward healthier strategies.

I then turned to meditation and started practicing intensively in a <a href="http://www.dhagpo-kagyu-ling.org/en/" target="_blank">Buddhist Center</a>, I actually loved that so much that I became a Buddhist monk for 10 years.

That was an awesome opportunity to learn meditation with qualified Masters and study the Buddhist path most of my time. I often mention the <a href="http://www.gr0wing.com/free-and-homeless-the-experiment-part-15/#more-3676" target="_blank">time I spent with Khenchen Rinpoche</a> learning from him and translating his teachings.

After ten years, though, I felt I was running in circles, I needed to grow beyond that religious frame, so I decided to give back my monk&#8217;s vows and returned to a normal lifestyle in 2008.

Since then, I met Vilma, my beautiful wife, who gives me all the love that I need (wrapped in enough intelligence to make life meaningful and fun).

I work in the IT area for a living, practice yoga, meditation and a lot of others methods that I talk about on this website.

There&#8217;s still so much more I want to say&#8230;I&#8217;ll keep sharing it post by post.

I hope to <a href="http://eepurl.com/zxyeT" target="_blank">count you in my connections</a> soon :)
